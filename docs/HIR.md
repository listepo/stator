# HIR — the typed intermediate representation

This document is **normative**. The Stator compiler produces and transforms one intermediate representation: a typed, structurally-scoped HIR with explicit type information on every node. Lower passes and the code generator speak HIR and nothing else; `ts.Type` never leaks past the frontend gate (`src/frontend/`).

Per plan.md §6 Task 3.1, this document is read before implementing any phase beyond the skeleton; where this document and the code disagree, this file is right and the code is a bug.

## 1. Shape of the IR

The HIR is **structured control flow, not SSA**. Every node has an explicit `HType` and a source `Span`. Expressions and statements are separate unions—statements are not expressions.

### 1.1 Why structured, not SSA?

The compiler emits C, and C has its own `if`/`while`/`goto` control structures. An SSA form would need to be lowered back to structured control flow to emit C correctly. The cost—constructing SSA, then un-SSA'ing it—is paid twice with no optimization benefit when the target is a structured language. Keeping the IR structured from the start means C emission is **the identity transformation on control flow**: an `if-statement` HIR node becomes an `if()` in C directly.

### 1.2 Span — source location

Every node carries a `Span`:

```typescript
interface Span {
  readonly start: number;        // 0-indexed UTF-16 offset
  readonly length: number;       // span length in UTF-16 units
  readonly line: number;         // 1-indexed line for #line directives
}
```

These are UTF-16 offsets because the TypeScript API uses them; the frontend copies them directly from `ts.Node` without conversion. The `line` field is 1-indexed and is computed once during lowering—the emitter never has to recompute it from source text, so source never leaks below the frontend.

### 1.3 Expressions and statements

Expressions produce values; statements do not. An expression-statement wraps an expression and discards its value.

**Expression union** (current scope):
- `NumberLiteral` — a numeric value
- `StringLiteral` — a string value
- `BooleanLiteral` — `true` or `false`
- `NullLiteral` — `null`
- `UndefinedLiteral` — `undefined`. Not a keyword but a global binding, so the lowering resolves it through the binding table first: a local named `undefined` shadows it, exactly as at runtime
- `Identifier` — reference to a binding
- `BinaryOp` — the nineteen operators whose operands are **both** evaluated, exactly once, left to right: `+ - * / %`, `< > <= >=`, `=== !== == !=`, `& | ^ << >> >>>`
- `UnaryOp` — prefix `-`, `+`, `!`, `~`
- `TypeOf` — `typeof x`. Not a `UnaryOp`: it runs no conversion (it is total on every value, where the other four run ToNumber or ToBoolean) and its type is `string`, where `UnaryOp`'s is fixed to `number` or `boolean` by the verifier's own rule (`STA4055`)
- `BoundaryCheck` — the one node where an `Unknown` becomes concrete, carrying the checked type and a `file:line:col`. Its presence in the HIR IS the statement that a boundary was crossed; see §3.2.1 for where the lowering builds one (`STA4056`)
- `LogicalOp` — `&&`, `||`, `??`
- `TemplateLiteral` — `` `a${x}b` ``, as `quasis` and `expressions` with the invariant `quasis.length === expressions.length + 1`
- `StringLength` — `.length` on a string, in **UTF-16 code units** (an astral character counts twice)
- `ConsoleLogCall` — builtin console call. `method` names one of the eleven members of `CONSOLE_METHODS` (`src/hir/nodes.ts`), the single table the gate, the lowering, the verifier and the emitter all read: it gives each member its arity, how many trailing arguments are optional, and the C entry point the emitter calls. `args` is therefore either exactly `arity` long or, for the two members whose omitted tail is its own C entry point (`group`, `assert`), that minus its optional tail: the lowering pads an omitted optional with an `undefined` literal only where explicit `undefined` means what absence means. `consoleEntryPoint(method, width)` maps a width to the C call, and `STA4019` holds every node to a width it answers
- `FunctionExpr` — a function expression or arrow function; `params`, a `body` Block, an
  optional `name` (a declaration's name, or the binding a function expression is assigned to, so
  `[Function: name]` survives to the runtime), and a `provenance` grade (plan.md §8 step 1). The
  grade is about the SIGNATURE and answers where its types came from: `typed` if the author
  annotated it whole — `x: number` and `@param {number} x` are the same claim in two spellings —
  `inferred` if the checker finished it, and `dynamic` if an `Unknown` is anywhere in it, which
  outranks the other two because an un-annotated `js` parameter is a request for a dynamic value
  rather than an omission. A fully annotated function whose BODY holds an `Unknown` is still
  `typed`: callers see the signature, and the signature is what a boundary checks. `stator explain`
  prints it per function; it is not a trust ordering (see plan-notes 140)
- `CallExpr` — a call to an arbitrary callee expression

`TemplateLiteral` is a node rather than sugar for `+`, and this is the same kind of decision as
`LogicalOp` below. The two agree on every primitive and diverge at objects: `` `${o}` `` is defined
as ToString, while `"" + o` runs ToPrimitive with hint *default* and therefore consults `valueOf`
**first**. Desugaring while only primitives exist would bake that difference in as a bug that first
appears when objects land, in code nobody is looking at any more.

`StringLength` is a dedicated node for the same reason `ConsoleLogCall` is: the subset admits
exactly one property, and giving it a node keeps the gate's accept set equal to this vocabulary.
The gate tests the *type* of the receiver, not the syntax — `arr.length` and `fn.length` are spelled
identically and neither is representable here. General property access arrives with the object model.

`LogicalOp` is deliberately **not** a `BinaryOp`, and the separation is load-bearing rather than
cosmetic. The two differ in both ways a compiler cares about: the right operand is evaluated
*conditionally*, and the result is one of the operands rather than a fresh value. `a && b` is not
`and(a, b)`; it is `let t = a; t ? b : t`. Folding it into `BinaryOp` would license any pass that
assumes "both children are evaluated" to hoist work out of a branch that may never run.

For the same reason the emitter gives each `LogicalOp` its own **frame slot** for the left
operand: the value is tested and then possibly returned, so evaluating it twice would duplicate
its side effects, and a value the GC cannot see is a value it can collect. Nested short-circuits
therefore need distinct slots — in `(a && b) && c` the outer operand stays live while the inner
one is evaluated.

**Statement union** (current scope):
- `Declaration` — `let` or `const` binding with required initializer. `var` is desugared by the lowering into a hoisted `let` initialized `undefined` plus an assignment at the original site (plan.md §8 step 3); it is not a third `declKind`.
- `Assignment` — assignment to an existing binding
- `ExpressionStatement` — wraps an expression
- `IfStatement` — `if` (optionally with `else`)
- `WhileStatement` — `while` loop
- `DoWhileStatement` — `do`/`while`; the body runs before the first test
- `ForStatement` — C-style `for`; all three header slots optional, `init`/`update` are Statements
- `SwitchStatement` — a discriminant and clauses in **source order**, `default` included
- `BreakStatement` / `ContinueStatement` — optionally labelled
- `FunctionDeclaration` — a named function; the binding is established at the **top of its unit**,
  not where the statement appears, so `f(); function f() {}` works
- `ReturnStatement` — `return`, with an optional value
- `Block` — sequence of statements

Rung 5 added `ArrayLiteral`, `ArrayLength`, `IndexAccess` (a read), `IndexAssignment` (a write) and `ForOfStatement`.

Rung 6a added classes: `ClassDeclaration` (a statement, in source order — a class is in its temporal dead zone until its declaration is reached), `NewExpr`, `FieldAccess` (a read), `FieldAssignment` (a write) and `MethodCall`. Three decisions in that set are load-bearing:

- **There is no `this` node.** A constructor or method's `params` begins with a receiver under a name no source can spell, and `this` lowers to an ordinary `Identifier` reading it. That reduction is why methods needed no machinery of their own: they inherit the closure ABI, arity padding, capture analysis and the static-closure path unchanged, and an arrow inside a method that closes over `this` is just an arrow capturing a parameter.
- **`FieldAccess` and `FieldAssignment` store a `slot`, resolved once during lowering.** The point is not speed — the emitter could recompute it — but *checkability*: a recomputed index is correct by construction and therefore unfalsifiable, while a stored one is verified against the layout it claims to index (`STA4046`).
- **A method has no slot and is not in `HObject.fields`.** One function is shared by every instance, so `MethodCall` names the class and the emitter makes a direct call, rather than every object carrying one closure per method.

Rung 6b added `InstanceOf`. It carries a class **name** and an ordinary target expression, for the same reason `NewExpr` does: the emitter reaches one file-scope descriptor, and `x instanceof (cond ? A : B)` has none to reach. The target is deliberately unconstrained — `1 instanceof C` is `false`, not an error — so the node's only invariant is that its type is `boolean` (`STA4050`). Inheritance did not change this node: the parent-link walk went inside the runtime helper, which is what "the emitter names the class, never the offset" buys.

Rung 6b then added inheritance: `HObject` grew a `bases` list (nearest ancestor first), `ClassDeclaration` grew an optional `base` name, and `SuperCall` joined the statements. Four decisions there are load-bearing:

- **`HObject.fields` is the WHOLE layout, base fields first.** A subclass's field list is not "its own fields, plus a pointer to its base's" — it is one flat list that starts with its base's, in the base's own slot order. Every existing node keeps working unchanged: `FieldAccess` resolves a slot against the flat list, and a base-typed read of a subclass instance resolves the same index it would on a base instance. That prefix property, and nothing else, is what makes `hTypeAssignable` sound — a `Dog` is a legal value for an `Animal` binding because the first N slots of a `Dog` *are* an `Animal`.
- **`MethodCall.className` is the DECLARING class, not the receiver's.** `d.describe()` on a `Dog` names `Animal` when `Animal` is where `describe` is written, because that is the function a direct call reaches. The verifier checks ancestry rather than equality (`STA4047`).
- **`MethodCall.dispatch` is a fact about the program, not about the call site.** A method is `virtual` exactly when some chain containing the receiver's class declares it twice — which the lowering asks of the whole file, because a call through a base-typed reference may land on any descendant. Everything else stays `direct` and costs exactly what rung 6a's call cost. `super.m()` is `direct` even where the same method is virtual everywhere else: skipping the override is what `super` means, and a virtual call there would find the override again and recur.
- **`ClassDeclaration.vtable` is empty for a class that participates in no overriding.** That is a real answer rather than a missing one: a table's entries are file-scope constants, so a class whose methods capture could not have one, which is why the gate refuses overriding for a class declared inside a function.
- **`SuperCall` is a statement, not an expression.** It names the BASE, carries the receiver explicitly, and evaluates to nothing: it is the base constructor run against the receiver this constructor was handed, not an allocation. Making it a statement is what lets the field-initializer prologue be *inserted after it* — initializers must run once the base has written its fields, since one may read them.
- **A derived class always has a constructor in the HIR, even when the source writes none.** The lowering synthesizes JavaScript's implicit `constructor(...args) { super(...args) }`, taking the parameters of the nearest ancestor that actually declares one. Without it a `new Blob(…)` would allocate the slots and run nothing.

Rung 6b then added statics, as `ClassDeclaration.statics` — a list of ordinary `Declaration`
statements, not a node kind. A static belongs to the class OBJECT rather than to any instance, so it
is not a slot: it is one binding for the whole program, under a name no source can spell (`C.count`,
where the dot does what the receiver parameter's leading space does). That reduction is the whole
design — a static read is an `Identifier`, a write is an `Assignment`, and `C.m()` is a `CallExpr` —
and it is why statics needed no verifier case and no emitter case of their own. Two details are
load-bearing: the name carries the **declaring** class, because statics are inherited and `Sub.count`
must be the same binding as `Base.count`; and the declarations ride on the class node rather than
being spliced into the enclosing statement list, so a class stays one statement in source order and
its statics initialize exactly where it sits.

`#private` members added no HIR surface at all. A `#count` is a field like any other, `#step()` is a
member function like any other, and `static #next` is a static binding like any other — the name
simply keeps its `#`. Privacy is a *checker* fact: every access from outside the class body is
already an error before the gate runs, so no node below it has anything left to enforce. The one
place the `#` still matters is printing, and it matters in the runtime rather than here: the printer
skips a descriptor field whose name starts with `#`. The layout is what forced the two deferrals — a
subclass re-declaring an ancestor's `#private` name is two slots sharing a spelling, which a list
keyed by name cannot hold apart, and `#brand in o` asks whether a slot exists rather than reading it.

Accessors added no HIR surface either, for the reason `#private` did not: a getter is a method under
the name `get x` and a setter one under `set x`, where the space is unspellable exactly as the
static's dot is. `o.x` lowers to a `MethodCall` with no arguments and `o.x = v` to one with a single
argument, wrapped in an `ExpressionStatement` — the property occupies no slot, so nothing in the
layout, the printer or the verifier had to learn what an accessor is.

`ObjectLiteral` is the one node the object work did add, and it is deliberately thin: a list of
`{name, value}` entries whose `type` is the shape they build. There is no descriptor in the node and
no key in the emitted code — the entries ARE the slots, in written order, and the verifier's job is
only to check that that order matches the shape's field list. Everything else a literal needs is the
class machinery it borrows: the same allocation, the same `FieldAccess` for a read, and a descriptor
whose name is empty so the printer omits the prefix a class instance gets.

Task 4.1 added the dynamic residue's three nodes — `DynObjectLiteral`, `DynFieldAccess`,
`DynFieldAssignment` — for a literal whose contextual type has an optional property or an index
signature, and therefore no fixed slot list. They mirror their fixed-path twins minus the `slot`:
the property is a NAME resolved through the shape table at run time, with a per-site inline cache
(docs/VALUE.md §4.10). Two invariants carry the design:

- **Everything dynamic types `Unknown`, and the verifier enforces it (`STA4059`).** A
  `DynFieldAccess` result and its target are Unknown by definition — an absent optional property
  reads as `undefined`, so any concrete type on the node is a narrowing nothing proved. The
  consumer narrows the value back the way it narrows a `Map.get`.
- **No pending check follows a dynamic access.** `jsrt_get_prop` allocates nothing and runs no
  user code; `jsrt_set_prop` can grow slot storage — which is why its operands sit in rooted
  frame slots. A nullish receiver is a TypeError; a primitive read answers `undefined`; a
  primitive write is a TypeError; growing a *new* key on a fixed-layout object is `STA2004`
  (Phase 8). Reads and writes of an existing field on an aliased fixed object walk the class
  descriptor. An Unknown (or empty `{}`) receiver uses the same three nodes; a computed index
  on one emits `jsrt_dyn_index_get`/`set`, which dispatches arrays to the dense path and
  everything else through the property table. Calling a non-function is `STA2006` at `file:line`.

`CollectionNew` and `CollectionOp` are the two nodes rung 7 added for `Map` and `Set`. Each names a
`collection` (`'map'` or `'set'`) and, for the operation, one of a closed set of `op`s —
`get`, `set`, `has`, `delete`, `clear`, `add`, `size`, `forEach` — with a target and an argument
list. The
closed set is the point: an operation is not a general method call that happens to land on a builtin,
it is one HIR node the emitter turns into one runtime function with a fixed C signature. `.size` is
an `op` with no arguments rather than a `FieldAccess`, so nothing below reads the struct field. The
verifier checks the receiver's type kind and the argument count for both, because every `jsrt_value`
argument has the same C type and the C compiler cannot catch either mistake.

The seven ES2025 set operations are `op`s too, and they are the only ones whose ARGUMENT is a
collection: the emitter passes it to a runtime function that reads it as a `JSRTMap`, so the
verifier checks the argument's type kind (`STA4053`) rather than trusting the arity count, and pins
the result — a Set for the four combining forms, a boolean for the three predicates. The `SET_OPS`
table in `src/hir/nodes.ts` is the one place that membership and those answers are written down;
the gate, the verifier and the emitter all read it.

`forEach` is the one collection op that runs USER CODE: the runtime calls the callback through
`jsrt_call`, exactly as the `Array.prototype` callback ops do, so the emitter gives it the same
treatment those get — the call is emitted as its own STATEMENT and a pending check follows it, so a
`throw` from the callback reaches its landing pad instead of being read as a result. The iterator
forms (`keys`, `values`, `entries`) stay out for a different reason entirely: they hand back an
ITERATOR, and the subset has no node for one.

Task 4.2 added `MathCall` on the CollectionOp precedent: a closed method set, exact arity, one
runtime function per operation, no function value anywhere. Post-lowering arity is FIXED at one or
two — the lowering folds variadic `min`/`max` into nested binary nodes and the zero-argument forms
into their identity literals — and the verifier pins arity plus the number-in/number-out contract
(`STA4080`), because every `jsrt_value` argument looks alike to the C compiler. `Math.PI` and the
other constants need no node: they fold to number literals during lowering, bit-for-bit the doubles
the pinned Node holds.

The String slice added `StringOp` the same way, with one structural difference: the closed set lives in a TABLE (`STRING_OPS` in `nodes.ts`, op → {arity, result}) rather than in per-op code, and the gate, the lowering, the verifier, and the emitter all read it — the emitter derives each C name mechanically (`camelCase` → `jsrt_string_snake_case`), so adding an op is one table row plus one C function. The lowering pads omitted optional arguments with `undefined` literals, which is sound because ECMA-262 treats explicit `undefined` as absent for every op in the set; the verifier (`STA4081`) then pins the string receiver, the exact post-padding arity, and the table's result type, while leaving argument types unchecked — the runtime coerces per spec, and `indexOf(1)` is legal JavaScript the gate already admitted.

The Array slice added `ArrayOp` on the identical pattern (`ARRAY_OPS`, verifier `STA4082`, C names `jsrt_array_*`), with two result kinds `STRING_OPS` never needed: `self` — the RECEIVER's own array type, for the ops that slice, copy, or mutate-and-return it — and `element`, which is Unknown by the IndexAccess rule, because `pop` on an empty array really answers `undefined` and a narrower type would be the compiler asserting what the runtime cannot honour. The callback methods (`forEach map filter some every find findIndex`) joined the same table: their single argument is a closure the runtime calls through `jsrt_call` — the compiled world's own ABI — and two result kinds came with them: `mapped` (the CHECKER's answer, for `map`'s free element choice and `filter`'s type-guard narrowing; pinned only to "some array") and `undefined` (`forEach`). `reduce`/`reduceRight` (with-initial form) brought a third: `checker` — the checker's answer with nothing pinned, because the accumulator's type is whatever the callback and the initial value agreed on.

The Object slice added `ObjectStaticCall` — `Object.keys/values/entries`, a NAMESPACE call like `MathCall` rather than a method on a receiver, one argument in one rooted slot. `keys` is pinned to `string[]` (`STA4083`); `values`/`entries` are pinned only to "some array", because their element follows the checker's answer and `entries` produces `[string, T]` pairs the HType model has no tuple for — that element is honestly Unknown, and an `entries` call is what makes an otherwise fully-typed file report `dynamic`. The node carries an argument LIST rather than a single argument, because the namespace is not uniformly unary: `hasOwn` takes an object and a key. Arity is fixed per method by the gate's `OBJECT_STATICS` table and restated in the verifier's `OBJECT_STATIC_SHAPES`, whose result kinds pin what each method can be pinned to — `string[]` for `keys`/`getOwnPropertyNames`, a boolean for `hasOwn`, “some array” for `values`/`entries`, and nothing at all for `fromEntries`, which builds a dynamic shape and is therefore Unknown outright.

The JSON slice added `JsonStringify` — `JSON.stringify(v)` in its single-argument form, the same one-argument-one-slot namespace shape as `ObjectStaticCall`, pinned to `string` (`STA4085`). The pin is why the gate refuses argument types that admit `undefined` or a function at the TOP level: there the spec answers `undefined`, not a string. Inside a structure both serialize per spec (skipped as object values, `null` as array elements), and a cycle aborts loudly at run time on the STA2005 pattern.

`JsonParse` is its mirror and the same single-slot shape, but the opposite of pinned: nothing about its result is checked. The lowering types it `Unknown` — the argument is text, and a type annotation on data nobody has read yet is a claim, not a fact — so `explain` reports the call as the point where the program becomes dynamic, and the boundary machinery from Task 3.5 (`typeof` narrowing, an `as` cast) is what settles each use. The verifier leaves the type alone rather than pinning it, so a later pass that proves something concrete about a parsed value is free to say so.

Task 4.3 added `RegExpLiteral` and `RegExpOp`. The literal carries the pattern and the flags as two
STRINGS, split at the last `/` of the token, and neither is parsed anywhere above the C boundary —
the vendored engine (quickjs-ng's libregexp) is the only thing that reads them, which is what keeps
this compiler from disagreeing with it about what a pattern means. It is a literal but NOT a
constant: §22.2.4.1 makes every evaluation a fresh object, and it has to be, because `lastIndex` is
mutable state ON that object, so the emitter compiles the pattern at each evaluation rather than
hoisting it. The verifier's only claim about the node is its own kind (`STA4086`).

`RegExpOp` is `StringOp`'s shape over the `REGEXP_OPS` table, with one difference in what the
verifier pins: the receiver kind is load-bearing in a way a string op's is not, because
`jsrt_regexp_test` dereferences it as a `JSRTRegExp` without asking — a wrong kind there is memory
corruption, not a wrong answer. The argument is deliberately unchecked for `STA4081`'s reason: an
untyped subject is the js-mode norm, and the bridge's own tag check is the honest place to settle
it. `test` is the whole table for now; `exec` is absent because it answers an ARRAY WITH PROPERTIES
(`index`, `input`, `groups` hang off the match array) and a jsrt array is dense with no property
table, so landing it would mean either a wrong answer or a representation change.

Task 4.2's Date slice added three nodes on the same table discipline, and one of them is
interesting for what it does NOT need. `DateOp` is `StringOp`'s shape over `DATE_OPS`, with the
receiver kind pinned the way `RegExpOp`'s is (`STA4092`) — the `jsrt_date_*` accessors read a
`JSRTDate` without a tag test. The table writes each C name out explicitly rather than deriving
it, because the mechanical `camelCase → snake_case` rule the string and array ops use turns
`getUTCFullYear` into `get_u_t_c_full_year`; that is the whole reason `DATE_OPS` carries an `fn`
field where `STRING_OPS` carries none. `DateStaticCall` is `ObjectStaticCall`'s namespace shape
over `DATE_STATICS`, pinned to `number` because both `Date.UTC` and `Date.parse` answer a time
value.

`DateNew` is the interesting one. It is neither a `NewExpr` (there is no descriptor and no
constructor body) nor a `CollectionNew` (that one never takes an argument), and it carries exactly
one argument for three source forms — a time value, an ISO string, another Date — because the
discrimination is a tag test the runtime has to make anyway, so hoisting it into three node kinds
would buy the compiler nothing it could then check. The ZERO-argument form gets no node at all:
§21.4.2.1 step 2 defines `new Date()` as the current time value, so the lowering desugars it to
`new Date(Date.now())` — a `date-static` sitting in the `arg` slot. That is not padding, and the
distinction matters: `new Date(undefined)` is an Invalid Date, so an absent argument and an
explicit `undefined` are different programs, which is why the desugaring is to an explicit `now`
call rather than to the undefined-literal every other optional position gets.

Task 3.10 added exceptions, as two statements:

- **`ThrowStatement`** carries the thrown expression. Its type is `undefined`, but nothing consumes
  it: a throw completes abruptly. The emitter turns it into `jsrt_throw(v); goto <pad>;` where the
  pad is the innermost enclosing try's landing pad, or the unit's own unwind pad (docs/VALUE.md
  §4.9).
- **`TryStatement`** has a `tryBlock` plus at least one of `catchBlock` and `finallyBlock` — a try
  with neither is unbuildable from source and the verifier rejects it (`STA4057`), as it does a
  `catchBinding` without a `catchBlock`. The binding, when present, is typed **`Unknown`
  always**: anything can be thrown, so the catch variable is a narrowing point like any other
  boundary (§3.2.1), which is why `explain` does not count the binding itself as dynamic — only
  reads of it in the blocks.

Two decisions there are load-bearing:

- **The blocks are `Block` nodes, not statement lists**, because a catch binding is scoped to its
  block and DCE's scope-preservation argument (§6.3) applies to them unchanged.
- **There is no landing-pad node.** Which pad a throw reaches, the order finally bodies run in,
  and how a `return`/`break`/`continue` routes THROUGH a finally are all decided by the emitter,
  which lowers a try-with-finally to an `int` completion code (0 normal, 1 rethrow, 2+ one per
  distinct jump) dispatched after the finally body. Encoding that routing in the HIR would force
  every pass to preserve a control structure none of them can improve.

Future phases add: `for-in`, general property access, and the rest.

A loop or switch carries its own optional `label`; there is no LabeledStatement wrapper. A label exists only to be named by `break`/`continue`, so it belongs to the thing being jumped out of, and a wrapper would sit between the jump and its target for no gain.

Three shapes here exist to stop the emitter from being clever:

- **`ForStatement.condition` is optional, not defaulted to `true`.** `for (;;)` has no test, and a synthesised literal would make "no test" and "a test that happens to be true" indistinguishable.
- **`SwitchClause.statements` is not a `Block`.** A clause opens no scope and falls through into the next one; a Block would imply both are false.
- **Clauses keep source order, `default` in place.** `default` is *tried* last but still falls through from whatever clause precedes it textually, so hoisting it changes which statements run.

`switch` does not lower to a C `switch`, and cannot: C requires integer constant cases, while JavaScript compares with **strict equality** against arbitrary expressions. It becomes a chain of tests plus `goto`s into clause labels laid out in source order — which delivers fall-through by simply not jumping.

Jumps are always `goto`, never C's `break`/`continue`, so that a `break` inside a `switch` inside a loop cannot be silently captured by the wrong construct. The emitter writes a label only where a `goto` targets it: the runtime builds with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`, and an unused label is an error there.

**The invariant that governs every addition:** the gate's accept set (`src/frontend/gate.ts`) must equal this vocabulary *exactly*. A construct accepted above but unrepresentable below is not a missing feature — it is an `STA4xxx` internal error waiting to happen, the compiler blaming itself for source it chose to accept. Widening the HIR and widening the gate are the same change; make them in the same commit. This has been violated twice already (plan-notes 30 and 37), both times by constructs that reached the gate through a fast path rather than an explicit `case`.

### 1.4 Module root

A `Module` is the top-level container:

```typescript
interface Module {
  readonly kind: 'module';
  readonly fileName: string;      // absolute path, for #line directives
  readonly statements: readonly Statement[];
  readonly type: HType;           // usually undefined or the type of the last statement
}
```

---

## 2. The HType lattice

Stator's internal type model is small and structural. It is produced by exactly one module (`src/frontend/types.ts`) and is the only type vocabulary every pass and the emitter see.

### 2.1 Phase 2 types — the skeleton

The walking skeleton recognizes six kinds:

| Kind | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `number` | 64-bit IEEE double (all numbers, all numeric literals) | `1`, `1.5`, `Infinity` |
| `string` | UTF-16 string | `"hello"`, `` `template` `` |
| `boolean` | logical truth value | `true`, `false` |
| `undefined` | absence of a value | `undefined`, return-less function |
| `null` | the null singleton | `null` |
| `unknown` | unknown type, unknowable statically | `any`, `unknown`, untyped variable in js mode |

Each is a singleton (except `unknown`, which carries a flag—see §3).

### 2.2 Phase 3+ types — planned

`fn(params, ret)` landed with rung 4, `array<T>` with rung 5, and `object` — a class instance: a name, fields in slot order, and method signatures — with rung 6a. `object` is compared **nominally**, unlike every other kind: two classes that declare the same fields are still two classes, which matches what the emitter allocated (one descriptor per declaration) and is also the only comparison that terminates, since `class C { self: C }` is a cyclic type. Rung 7 added `map<K, V>` and `set<T>`.

Task 3.4 added one more, `type-param`, which is the single HType kind that must NEVER reach the HIR: it lives only inside `src/frontend/`, as the thing unification binds and substitution replaces. Monomorphization happens at the lowering, so a node carrying a `type-param` means a specialization was built outside its own substitution — the verifier refuses it as `STA4054`.

The following kinds **do not yet exist** in the code and are mentioned here only to state the plan explicitly. Do not implement them early and do not describe them as if they work:

- **`i32`** — refinement of `number` to 32-bit integers (Phase 3 optimization; all arithmetic promotes overflows back to `number`)
- **`union<T1 | T2 | ...>`** — union of concrete types (replaces implicit unions via widening)
- **`generic-instance<G, [A1, A2, ...]>`** — a generic type applied to concrete arguments. Not needed by Task 3.4 and possibly never: monomorphization erases the generic rather than representing it, so `box<number>` is a FunctionDeclaration named `box<number>` whose type is the ordinary `(number) => number`. A `generic-instance` kind becomes necessary only if a generic ever has to survive to runtime — a generic class stored in an `Unknown`, say

---

## 3. Unknown is first-class

`Unknown` is not an error state. It represents a type unknowable at compile time. In `ts` mode, `Unknown` from an implicit `any` is rejected at the gate; in `js` mode, `Unknown` is the dynamic path.

```typescript
interface HUnknown {
  readonly kind: 'unknown';
  readonly fromImplicitAny: boolean;  // gate-set flag
}
```

### 3.1 Where Unknown comes from

- Source `any` annotation (in `js` mode; in `ts` mode the gate rejects it first with `STA1001`)
- `unknown` type annotation
- Untyped code in `js` mode (inferred as `unknown`, not rejected)
- Union types whose constituents map to more than one HType. `string | number` is `Unknown`; `"a" | "b"` is NOT, because every constituent gives the same answer and widening to `string` invents nothing (Task 3.5). That widening is what makes `typeof` usable: TypeScript types it as a union of eight string literals
- `JSON.parse()` return value (always `unknown`)
- FFI boundary (`declare function` imports)
- `.js`→`.ts` imports (the imported value is runtime-typed, not statically typed)

### 3.2 The Unknown preservation rule

**This is the single most important rule in this document.** Every pass—const-fold, DCE, tree-shake, inline, any future optimization—must preserve `Unknown` exactly as it appears in the input. You may never:

- Elide a check on an `Unknown` value by proving it redundant
- Replace `Unknown` with a more specific type without a runtime check
- Propagate a type assumption across an `Unknown` boundary
- Constant-fold an operation whose operand is `Unknown`

**Why?** `Unknown` exists because the type is unknowable *at compile time*. If an optimizer "proves" it is redundant, it has proved something false: the source program has no type information to prove it. A boundary check is not optional; it is a **property of the type system itself** — the only way the compiled code can be correct when the type system has admitted we don't know the type.

**Invariant (enforced by the verifier):** Every value of type `Unknown` in the HIR must remain `Unknown` through lowering, optimization, and codegen. Codegen emits it as a tagged `jsrt_value` with a runtime check at every narrowing site.

### 3.2.1 What a narrowing site is (Task 3.5)

An `Unknown` becomes concrete in exactly one node, `BoundaryCheck`, and the lowering is the only thing that builds one — a later pass could not, because by then the HIR has already forgotten which type the checker narrowed to. Four spellings produce it: a read of an `Unknown` binding at a point where the checker has narrowed it (a `typeof` guard, an `instanceof`, an `!== undefined`); an `as` cast off an `Unknown`; a dynamic value flowing into an annotated binding, parameter, or return (plan.md §8 step 5 — the mixed-graph edge); and the same edge written in JSDoc (`/** @type {number} */ const n = produce()`). The emitted C is `jsrt_check_number/string/boolean(v, "file:line:col")`, which returns `v` or raises `STA2001`.

Three rules follow from the preservation rule above rather than from convenience:

- **Per use, not per binding.** Three reads inside one guard emit three checks. Hoisting to one would assert that the value did not change between them, which is a type assumption propagated across an `Unknown` boundary — the third bullet in the list above.
- **A narrowing to a type no TAG settles is dropped, not refused.** An object's shape, an array's element type and a function's signature cannot be checked in constant time, so those narrowings leave the value `Unknown` and it stays on the dynamic path. That IS the preservation rule; refusing instead would reject programs that already compile, in exchange for no soundness (see plan-notes 74).
- **An unnarrowed `Unknown` gets no check.** `console.log(x)` asks nothing of `x`. A check is inserted where a claim is made, not where a value is used.

### 3.2.2 How each pass satisfies the rule (Tasks 3.6–3.9)

The rule above is stated as a prohibition, which invites a pass to satisfy it with a check that a
reviewer has to trust. None of the three passes does that. Each satisfies it through the condition
that admits a rewrite at all, so violating it is not something the code could be edited into doing
without changing what the pass is:

- **Const-fold** folds only when every operand is a **literal node**. A literal is never `Unknown`,
  so the fourth bullet above is unreachable — and a literal has no side effect, so folding never
  deletes one either. One restriction, two properties.
- **DCE** reasons only about **control flow**: what follows a jump, which branch a literal condition
  takes, what can reach a function. It never asks what a value is, so it has no way to elide a check.
- **Inlining** requires the argument's HType to **equal** the parameter's. A `js`-mode call passing a
  `number` to an `Unknown` parameter therefore does not inline: substituting would replace an
  unknown-typed subtree with a typed one and cancel the check that unknown-ness requires.

### 3.3 Example

```typescript
// ts mode
const x: unknown = JSON.parse('1');  // type is unknown
const y = (x as number) + 1;         // jsrt_check_number: STA2001 at runtime if x is not a number

// js mode
const x = JSON.parse('1');           // type is unknown (inferred)
const y = x + 1;                     // dynamic path: operator overload on jsrt_value
```

In both cases, `Unknown` is preserved; the difference is the route (explicit boundary check vs. dynamic operator).

---

## 4. TypeScript types map to HType

`src/frontend/types.ts` is the **only** module that maps `ts.Type` → `HType`. It is called once per expression/statement in the frontend, immediately after the type checker assigns a type. Nothing below the gate sees `ts.Type`.

### 4.1 The mapping algorithm

```typescript
export function tsTypeToHType(type: ts.Type): HType {
  const f = type.flags;

  // Primitives must match their LITERAL flag too.
  if (f & (ts.TypeFlags.Number | ts.TypeFlags.NumberLiteral)) {
    return H_NUMBER;
  }
  if (f & (ts.TypeFlags.String | ts.TypeFlags.StringLiteral)) {
    return H_STRING;
  }
  if (f & (ts.TypeFlags.Boolean | ts.TypeFlags.BooleanLiteral)) {
    return H_BOOLEAN;
  }
  // void is distinct in TypeScript but undefined at runtime.
  if (f & (ts.TypeFlags.Undefined | ts.TypeFlags.Void)) {
    return H_UNDEFINED;
  }
  if (f & ts.TypeFlags.Null) {
    return H_NULL;
  }

  // Both explicit and implicit `any` are Unknown.
  if (f & ts.TypeFlags.Any) {
    return hUnknown(true);  // conservative: set flag for gate to reject if implicit
  }

  // Everything Phase 2 cannot represent: union, array, function, etc.
  return hUnknown(false);
}
```

**Key invariant:** If the type checker produced a type, and this function returns `Unknown`, it is because Phase 2 has no representation for it. This is never a guess; `Unknown` here means the type is *representable but not yet implemented*.

### 4.2 Worked examples

Each example shows a TypeScript snippet, what `ts.Type` the checker produces, the resulting `HType`, and the reason.

#### Example 1: Number literal

**TypeScript:**
```typescript
const x = 1;
```

**`ts.Type`:** `Type { isNumberLiteral: true, value: 1 }` — the literal type `1`, not the general `number` type.

**`HType`:** `{ kind: 'number' }`

**Why:** `tsTypeToHType` checks `TypeFlags.Number | TypeFlags.NumberLiteral` and both match. **Critical detail from plan-notes #32:** TypeScript's `NumberLiteral` flag includes the general `Number` flag; we must check both and map them all to the single `number` HType. An early version mapped only the `NumberLiteral` flag and broke on bare `number` annotations. The `| TypeFlags.Number` part is the fix.

#### Example 2: String literal

**TypeScript:**
```typescript
const s = "hello";
```

**`ts.Type`:** `Type { isStringLiteral: true, value: "hello" }`

**`HType`:** `{ kind: 'string' }`

**Why:** Same as above; both `StringLiteral` and `String` flags are checked.

#### Example 3: Boolean literal type

**TypeScript:**
```typescript
const b: true = true;
```

**`ts.Type`:** `Type { isBooleanLiteral: true, value: true }` — the literal type `true`.

**`HType`:** `{ kind: 'boolean' }`

**Why:** `BooleanLiteral` and `Boolean` flags both match. The HIR has one `boolean` type; `true` and `false` are runtime values, not compile-time constants at the type level.

#### Example 4: Generic boolean type

**TypeScript:**
```typescript
let b: boolean;
b = true;
```

**`ts.Type`:** `Type { flags: TypeFlags.Boolean }` — the general `boolean` type, not a literal.

**`HType`:** `{ kind: 'boolean' }`

**Why:** The check `TypeFlags.Boolean` alone matches, same `HType`. All three — the literal type `true`, the literal type `false`, and the general `boolean` type — map to one `boolean` HType because the HIR tracks type, not specific values.

#### Example 5: The `void` keyword

**TypeScript:**
```typescript
function f(): void { }
```

**`ts.Type`:** `Type { flags: TypeFlags.Void }` — TypeScript's way of saying "no return value."

**`HType`:** `{ kind: 'undefined' }`

**Why:** `void` is a TypeScript compile-time concept meaning "you can ignore the return." At runtime, a function that doesn't return anything returns `undefined`. The HIR models *values*, not compile-time intent, so `void` and `undefined` are the same.

#### Example 6: Explicit `any` in js mode

**TypeScript (js mode):**
```typescript
const x: any = 1;
```

**`ts.Type`:** `Type { flags: TypeFlags.Any }`

**`HType`:** `{ kind: 'unknown', fromImplicitAny: true }`

**Why:** The check `TypeFlags.Any` matches. The `fromImplicitAny` flag is set `true` conservatively (see §4.1 comment). The gate later checks `isImplicitAny()` on the actual TS AST node; if it finds the annotation was explicit, the gate still keeps the flag set because:
1. `tsTypeToHType` does not have access to the AST, only the type.
2. The gate's job is to filter; the conservative flag makes the gate safe: if unsure, reject in `ts` mode.
3. In `js` mode, the flag is ignored; `Unknown` compiles as dynamic either way.

#### Example 7: Implicit `any` in ts mode

**TypeScript (ts mode):**
```typescript
let x;  // no initializer, no annotation
```

**`ts.Type`:** `Type { flags: TypeFlags.Any }` — inferred as `any` because nothing narrows it.

**`HType`:** `{ kind: 'unknown', fromImplicitAny: true }`

**Why:** Identical to example 6 at the type level. The gate calls `isImplicitAny(node, typeChecker)` on the actual `VariableDeclaration` node; if it returns `true`, the gate emits `STA1003` and the declaration is rejected in `ts` mode.

#### Example 8: Unknown type annotation (ts mode)

**TypeScript (ts mode):**
```typescript
const x: unknown = 1;
```

**`ts.Type`:** `Type { flags: TypeFlags.Unknown }` — the `unknown` keyword.

**`HType`:** `{ kind: 'unknown', fromImplicitAny: false }`

**Why:** TypeScript has two type flags for "don't know": `Any` (implicit or explicit `any`) and `Unknown` (the `unknown` keyword). We map both to `unknown` HType, but the `fromImplicitAny` flag is `true` only if `TypeFlags.Any` was set. Since `unknown` is an explicit annotation, the flag is `false`, and the gate does not reject it in `ts` mode—`unknown` is the approved way to say "I don't know the type."

#### Example 9: Union type

**TypeScript:**
```typescript
const x: number | string = 1;
```

**`ts.Type`:** `Type { flags: TypeFlags.Union, types: [Type{Number}, Type{String}] }` — a union of two types.

**`HType`:** `{ kind: 'unknown', fromImplicitAny: false }`

**Why:** Phase 2 has no `union` HType. The union exists in the type system but not in the HIR. When the lowering sees this, it must insert a runtime check (boundary-check insertion, Phase 3 Task 3.5) to narrow the union before using the value. Until then, it is `Unknown`, which triggers:
- In `ts` mode: the gate rejects it as unsupported (STA1214, "not yet").
- In `js` mode: it is the dynamic path.

#### Example 10: Function type

**TypeScript:**
```typescript
const f: (x: number) => string = ...;
```

**`ts.Type`:** `Type { flags: TypeFlags.Object, objectFlags: ObjectFlags.ClassOrInterface, ... }` — internally represents function types as interface-like objects.

**`HType`:** `{ kind: 'unknown', fromImplicitAny: false }`

**Why:** Phase 2 has no `fn` HType. Functions arrive in Phase 3. The gate rejects this as not-yet (STA1214).

#### Example 11: Array type

**TypeScript:**
```typescript
const arr: number[] = [1, 2];
```

**`ts.Type`:** `Type { flags: TypeFlags.Object, ... }` — arrays are objects with special properties.

**`HType`:** `{ kind: 'unknown', fromImplicitAny: false }`

**Why:** implemented in Phase 3 Task 3.3 rung 5. `checker.isArrayType` maps `T[]` and `Array<T>` to `HArray`; a TUPLE is deliberately excluded, since it has a different type per position and `HArray` holds one element type for all of them.

#### Example 12: Enum (ts mode)

**TypeScript (ts mode):**
```typescript
enum Color { Red = 0, Green = 1 }
const c: Color = Color.Red;
```

**`ts.Type`:** `Type { flags: TypeFlags.Number | TypeFlags.Enum, ... }` — enums are number-like.

**`HType`:** `{ kind: 'unknown', fromImplicitAny: false }`

**Why:** Enums are **deliberately excluded**, even though `TypeFlags.NumberLike` includes them. The gate (via `gateConstruct`) rejects enum declarations outright with `STA1104` (a never code: `erasableSyntaxOnly` bans them, and the enum AST node never reaches lowering). If lowering did see one, mapping it to `number` would hide the gate's rejection. The `tsTypeToHType` function and lowering are not the gate's agents; they assume the gate has already filtered the input. **Envelope principle:** the gate's accept set must equal the HIR's vocabulary exactly.

## 5. The HIR verifier

The verifier is a post-transform invariant checker. It runs after every pass that modifies the HIR (lowering, const-folding, DCE, inline) to ensure the pass produced valid HIR.

### 5.1 What the verifier checks

Each check is a compiler invariant. If it fails, the compiler has contradicted itself—the gate accepted a construct and the pass produced invalid HIR for it.

**Type presence:** Every node has an `HType`. Missing `type` → `STA4020`.

**Binding scope:** Every `Identifier` reference refers to a binding declared before use. Using a name never declared → `STA4002`. Assigning to a name never declared → `STA4003`.

**Type agreement:** The type of each expression matches the operation that produced it:
- `NumberLiteral` must have type `number` → `STA4007`
- `StringLiteral` must have type `string` → `STA4008`
- `BooleanLiteral` must have type `boolean` → `STA4009`
- `Identifier` must have the type of the binding it refers to → `STA4010`
- Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`) must have both operands of type `number` and result type `number` → `STA4011`, `STA4012`, `STA4013`
- Comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) must have operands of matching type (number or string, not mixed) and result type `boolean` → `STA4014`, `STA4015`, `STA4016`
- Strict equality (`===`, `!==`) must have operands of matching type and result type `boolean` → `STA4017`, `STA4018`
- An `ArrayOp` whose `ARRAY_OPS` entry carries `calls` is emitted as its own statement followed by
  `if (jsrt_pending()) goto pad;` — it runs compiled code and can therefore throw, and the check has
  to sit between the op and whatever consumes its result. Every other array op is a walk over the
  backing store that cannot unwind, and nests directly.
- A console call must have type `undefined`, and exactly as many arguments as `CONSOLE_METHODS` gives its method → `STA4019`

**Control flow:** `IfStatement` and `WhileStatement` conditions must have type `boolean` → `STA4005`, `STA4006`.

**Assignment compatibility:** An assignment's value type must match the target binding's type → `STA4004`.

### 5.2 Verifier output

The verifier returns a list of problems (not thrown exceptions). Each problem includes:
- `kind`: the HIR node kind (e.g., `'binary-op'`)
- `code`: the STA code (all codes in `STA4xxx`)
- `span`: the node's source location
- `message`: human-readable explanation

Example:
```
{
  kind: 'binary-op',
  code: 'STA4011',
  span: { start: 42, length: 1, line: 5 },
  message: 'arithmetic operand must be number, got string'
}
```

### 5.3 Verifier discipline

**When:** Once per build, on the OPTIMIZED module — `build.ts` lowers, optimizes, verifies, emits.

That ordering is the point rather than an implementation detail. What reaches the emitter is the
optimized module, so that is what has to be checked; verifying the lowering's output instead would
check a tree nothing emits and leave the one that does unchecked, turning a pass bug into a clang
error against generated C rather than an `STA4xxx`. In all builds, for now — §6 may add a flag to
skip it in release builds if measurements ever show it is a bottleneck.

**What counts as a verifier failure:** Always a compiler bug (`STA4xxx`), never a user error. The gate has already accepted the source and the lowering has already produced the HIR. A verifier failure means one of them violated an invariant—either the gate let through a construct it shouldn't have, or the pass produced invalid HIR. The verifier's job is to **catch bugs early**, before they cascade into wrong code.

**Envelope principle:** The invariant that holds the design together is simple:

> The set of constructs the gate accepts (`gateConstruct` in `src/frontend/gate.ts`) must equal the set of constructs the HIR can represent exactly. No more, no fewer.

If the gate accepts a construct but the HIR has no node type for it, lowering fails. If the HIR has a node type but the gate rejects it, the gate is wrong. A verifier problem always points to one of these disagreements.

---

## 6. The optimization passes

`src/passes/` holds the transformations that operate on a complete HIR. Two of the passes this plan
originally listed are **not** here — monomorphization (Task 3.4) and boundary-check insertion
(Task 3.5) both happen at the lowering, because each needs a fact that lives in the `ts.Type` world
and is gone by the time an HIR exists. A pass would have to reconstruct from the output what the
input already knew. See plan-notes.md entries 73 and 74.

### 6.1 The shared rewriter

`rewrite.ts` is a bottom-up, identity-preserving walk over every node kind, with exhaustive
switches. Exhaustive rather than reflective on purpose: a reflective walker handles a node kind
added later *silently*, which is the opposite of what is wanted for nodes with special evaluation
rules — `LogicalOp`'s right operand is conditional, and a walker that treated it as an ordinary
child would license hoisting work into a branch that may never run.

A `Rewriter` supplies up to three hooks, all called with children already rewritten:

| Hook | Signature | Why it exists |
|---|---|---|
| `expression` | `Expression => Expression` | The common case. |
| `statement` | `Statement => Statement[]` | A list says both useful answers: replace (`[s]`) and delete (`[]`). |
| `statements` | `Statement[] => Statement[]` | A statement can only speak for itself, so a pass reasoning about a **run** of them needs the run — `return` making its following siblings unreachable is the case. |

Returning a node by identity (`===`) is how a pass says "nothing happened", and the walk propagates
that upward, so an unoptimizable module comes back as the same object.

### 6.2 The three passes, and their order

`optimize()` applies them once, in an order that is a chain rather than a preference:

1. **`inlineCalls`** — replaces a call to a one-`return` function with the expression it returns.
   Exposes constants: `double(2)` becomes `2 * 2`.
2. **`constFold`** — evaluates operations over literal operands, using JavaScript's own operators.
   Decides branches: `if (1 < 2)` is not a literal condition until `1 < 2` is `true`.
3. **`eliminateDeadCode`** — drops statements after a jump, selects a literal-conditioned branch,
   removes `while (false)`, and shakes module-level functions nothing can reach. Runs last because
   eliminating a branch is what finally makes a function unreachable.

Once, not to a fixpoint: iterating would find a little more, at the cost of compile time and the
risk of an oscillating pass pair — a trade that wants a measurement (plan §13).

### 6.3 Where the passes decline

Every pass is defined as much by what it refuses, and each refusal names the thing that would
otherwise break:

- A `function` declaration after a `return` **survives** — it is hoisted, so it holds its binding
  for the code above it. Nothing else in the subset is: `let`, `const` and `class` all have a
  temporal dead zone starting where they are written.
- A selected branch stays a **`Block`**, not statements spliced into the parent list. A branch is
  its own scope, and splicing would promote its `let` bindings into the enclosing one.
- The shake covers functions, **not classes**: `new C()` names its class by string rather than by an
  identifier the reference walk would see.
- Inlining declines a body that names anything but its own parameters. The HIR resolves identifiers
  by **name**, so a body reading a module-level `g` moved into a caller with its own `g` would
  silently read the wrong one — and the same condition makes recursion impossible by construction.

---

## Notes

- **HIR stability:** The Phase 2 skeleton HIR (expressions, statements, control flow) is stable. Phases 3+ add new node kinds (arrays, objects, etc.) and new HType kinds (fn, array, object-shape, etc.). All existing nodes remain valid; new passes only have to handle new cases in their switch statements.

- **Scope and binding:** Phase 2 is expression-level and block-scoped only. Function scopes, function parameters and closure capture arrived with Phase 3 rung 4; Task 3.4 is monomorphization.

- **Type narrowing:** `typeof` guards and `as` casts became `BoundaryCheck` nodes in Task 3.5 (§3.2.1). Discriminated unions keyed on a tag still wait for a union the HType model can see the constituents of; until then `unknown` and unions stay wide.

- **Unknown is forever:** `Unknown` does not narrow during optimization — §3.2.2 records how each of the three passes makes that a property of its admission rule rather than a check. A type inference pass that "learns" a better type must emit a runtime check to validate it; without a check, `Unknown` stays.
