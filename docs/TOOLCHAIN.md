# TOOLCHAIN.md

The pinned toolchain (plan.md §4 Task 1.0 step 2). Differential ground truth is the Node in
`.node-version` — **that Node and only that Node**. Record any change here in the same commit
that changes the pin, and note the reason in `plan-notes.md`.

## Pinned

| Tool                      | Pin                | Where pinned                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Zig                       | `0.16.0`           | `mise.toml` (`zig`, Unix). Required for runtime builds once T9.1 lands (plan-notes 238). Pin is in place so the task is executable; main does not yet compile `src/*.zig`. CI install via `mlugg/setup-zig@v2` awaits creator approval. |

Node ≥ 24 is required because dev runs the compiler's TypeScript sources directly
(`node packages/compiler/src/cli/main.ts`) via native type stripping — there is no build step in development.

TypeScript is deliberately **not** on `latest`: `latest` is now 7.x (the Go port / tsgo), whose
public compiler API plan.md §0.3 rules out. `6.0.3` is the newest stable 6.x. Re-evaluate
quarterly and record the outcome in `plan-notes.md`.

Dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`, plan-notes 212) proposes weekly bumps for the npm tree and
the GitHub Actions, and cannot keep the rule above by itself: a PR from its `toolchain` group moves
a row of this table, so it needs that row and a `plan-notes.md` line before merge. It never
proposes a TypeScript or `@types/node` major. Node, pnpm, LLVM, just and Zig stay hand-bumped.

## Verified development host

The host this bootstrap was verified on (a data point, not a requirement):

```
node    v26.7.0
clang   Apple clang version 21.0.0 (clang-2100.1.1.101), arm64-apple-darwin25.5.0
just    1.58.0
git     2.50.1 (Apple Git-155)
os      Darwin 25.5.0 arm64
```

CI must run at least ubuntu-latest and macos-latest (plan.md §4 Task 1.0 step 10).

## Commands

```
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile   # install exactly the pinned tree
pnpm run ci                      # typecheck -> lint -> dupes -> unit -> runtime -> subset -> golden -> leak -> asan
pnpm run test                    # unit tests (the default; coverage is on-demand, not per-run)
pnpm run test:coverage           # unit tests + src/ coverage table; writes coverage/lcov.info (only when the table is the question — ~3.4x wall time)
pnpm run test:subset             # feature × mode decision matrix
pnpm run test:golden             # compile + run vs the pinned Node, byte-for-byte
pnpm run test262                 # Test262 slice against the pin in tests/test262/pin.json
pnpm run differential            # fuzzer vs Node (failures land in packages/tests/differential/failures/)
pnpm run bench:record            # refresh packages/tests/bench/baseline.json (this machine only)
just -f packages/runtime/justfile -d packages/runtime runtime          # packages/runtime/build/libjsrt.a          (clang -O2, -Werror; thin LTO where the linker allows)
just -f packages/runtime/justfile -d packages/runtime runtime-asan     # packages/runtime/build-asan/libjsrt.a     (-fsanitize=address,undefined -O1 -g)
just -f packages/runtime/justfile -d packages/runtime runtime-intl     # packages/runtime/build-intl/libjsrt.a     (ICU feature build)
just -f packages/runtime/justfile -d packages/runtime runtime-test     # print corpus vs Node
just -f packages/runtime/justfile -d packages/runtime runtime-clean
node packages/compiler/src/cli/main.ts build file.ts -o app [--mode=ts|js]
node packages/compiler/src/cli/main.ts explain file.ts --json
```

Release and sanitized runtime archives build into **separate** directories (`packages/runtime/build/` and
`build-asan/`) so a sanitized archive can never be linked into a release binary by accident.

Release links dead-strip (Task 3.12): builtins live in `libjsrt.a` compiled with
`-ffunction-sections -fdata-sections`, and the final link passes `-Wl,-dead_strip` (Mach-O) or
`-Wl,--gc-sections` (ELF), so a builtin the program never references is not in the binary —
function granularity, not the archive's .o granularity. Sanitized builds skip the stripping:
ASan's global-registration sections are exactly what `--gc-sections` is documented to drop.

Release archives are thin-LTO bitcode where the toolchain can link one (plan-notes 162): `just -f packages/runtime/justfile -d packages/runtime runtime` probes `-flto=thin` through `$CC`/`$AR` and records the flag in `packages/runtime/build/link-flags.txt`, so
the CLI's single clang call compiles the generated C to bitcode too and the runtime's accessors and
builtins inline across the archive boundary. ld64 and lld read bitcode archives; GNU ld needs the
LLVMgold plugin, and without it the probe fails and the archive is plain objects, reported on the
recipe's status line. Sanitized builds never use LTO. A probe result or Boehm status that differs
from the last build rebuilds every object (`packages/runtime/build*/cflags.txt`).

## Compile-time opt level (`STATOR_OPT` / `--opt`)

The final clang link of generated C defaults to `-O2` (non-asan). Override per build:

```
STATOR_OPT=0 node packages/compiler/src/cli/main.ts build file.ts -o app   # faster iterate
node packages/compiler/src/cli/main.ts build file.ts -o app --opt=3         # max clang opts
```

`--opt` wins over `STATOR_OPT` when both are set. ASan builds ignore this and keep `-O1 -g
-fsanitize=…`. The release runtime archive may already record `-flto=thin` in
`packages/runtime/build/link-flags.txt`; `extraLinkFlags()` picks that up so the generated C is
compiled as thin-LTO bitcode too when the archive was. Full PGO / a custom LLVM backend remains
§12 rung 6 and needs the Task 6.3 measurement gate before it is scheduled.

## Native libraries

None of these come from the npm tree. Vendored sources live in the repo and build with the runtime;
system libraries are discovered at runtime-build time and recorded in `packages/runtime/build*/link-flags.txt`, which
`packages/compiler/src/cli/build.ts` reads back — so the emitted program links exactly what the archive it links was
compiled against (plan-notes 106).

| Library                                              | Kind                            | Required                     | For                                                                                                                | Discovery / install                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| QuickJS-NG `libregexp` (+ `libunicode`, `cutils.h`)  | vendored, MIT                   | yes                          | the RegExp engine (golden rule 5)                                                                                  | `packages/runtime/vendor/quickjs-ng/` — provenance in its `VENDOR.md`                      |
| fdlibm (V8 `ieee754.cc`, mechanically ported to C11) | vendored, fdlibm + BSD-3-Clause | yes                          | `Math.sin` and 19 siblings, bit-identical to the pinned Node's                                                     | `packages/runtime/vendor/fdlibm/` — provenance in its `VENDOR.md`                          |
| libm (`-lm`)                                         | system                          | yes                          | `floor`/`trunc`/`sqrt`/`fmod` — ToInt32, array indexing, the print path                                            | part of libSystem on macOS (the flag is a no-op there), separate on glibc (plan-notes 122) |
| Boehm GC (`bdw-gc`)                                  | system                          | optional                     | the collector (`docs/VALUE.md` §4.12); without it the runtime falls back to plain `malloc`, no collection          | `pkg-config --libs bdw-gc`; macOS `brew install bdw-gc`, Debian `apt install libgc-dev`    |
| ICU (`icu-uc`, `icu-i18n`)                           | system                          | optional, feature build only | `Intl` — `just -f packages/runtime/justfile -d packages/runtime runtime-intl`, into `packages/runtime/build-intl/` | `pkg-config`; macOS `brew install icu4c`, Debian `apt install libicu-dev`                  |

The default archive is byte-identical whether or not ICU is installed on the host — that is why
Intl is a separate object directory rather than a flag on the default build.

Vendored code compiles with `-Wall` alone rather than the runtime's `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`
(plan-notes 101) and is never hand-edited. A version bump is `pnpm run vendor:update <name> [ref]`
(`packages/runtime/vendor/update.mjs`): it refetches the manifest's files at that ref — re-running `port.mjs`
over upstream's `ieee754.cc` for fdlibm — and prints the provenance rows for the directory's
`VENDOR.md`. `--check` validates the manifests offline. Re-vendoring at the pinned ref reproduces
the tree byte-for-byte, so `git status` after a run is the diff the bump actually introduces.

## Native tools

Beyond Node/pnpm (pinned above), the build shells out to:

| Tool            | Used by                                                              | For                                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `clang` (`$CC`) | justfile, `packages/compiler/src/cli/build.ts`                       | the runtime, the emitted C, and the final link           |
| `ar` (`$AR`)    | justfile                                                             | archiving `libjsrt.a`                                    |
| `just`          | justfile                                                             | the runtime build (pinned `1.58.0` in `mise.toml`)       |
| `zig`           | justfile (T9.1)                                                      | memory-core objects into `libjsrt.a` (pinned `0.16.0` in `mise.toml`; required once T9.1 lands) |
| `pkg-config`    | justfile                                                             | finding bdw-gc and ICU; absent means both are simply off |
| `diff`          | `just -f packages/runtime/justfile -d packages/runtime runtime-test` | the print corpus against Node, byte-for-byte             |

`clang` (and the rest of LLVM) and `zig` 0.16.0 are `mise install` on Unix. The other three still come from the Xcode
command-line tools (`xcode-select --install`) on macOS and from `binutils`/`pkg-config`/
`diffutils` on Debian/Ubuntu. A missing compiler is a diagnostic with the install hint (`STA0008`),
not a crash.

### macOS SDK fallback for a stale bundled linker

The pinned conda clang ships its own `ld`, which can lag the installed Xcode SDK: when the
SDK's `.tbd` files name arch variants the bundled `ld` cannot parse, every Darwin link
fails. The CLI link (`packages/compiler/src/cli/build.ts`), the justfile's `runtime-test`
corpus link, and the test-side consumer links (export-stubs, the FFI C-consumer) all handle
this the same way — one retry under the newest Command Line Tools SDK the old parser can
still read (`packages/compiler/src/support/toolchain.ts`), only after a failure carrying
that exact signature, never for an explicit `CC`. Green-path cost is zero; nothing is
recorded in `link-flags.txt`. Do not rebuild the runtime archive (`just runtime`) while a
golden run is linking against it — `ar` rewriting `libjsrt.a` mid-link surfaces as a
transient `library not found for -ljsrt` in exactly one fixture.

## Not yet required

These arrive with the phase that needs them; do not add them to CI before that:

- **`mlugg/setup-zig@v2`** — the CI install for Zig 0.16.0. The mise pin is already on main; the GitHub Action is a new third-party CI dependency and is **open for the creator** (plan-notes 238). Windows never builds the runtime, so that job would skip the action. Do not add it without approval.

- **Ryū** — **NOT vendored.** Planned by Phase 2 Task 2.5 for `runtime/vendor/ryu/`; it was never fetched, and `shortest_digits()` in `runtime/src/jsrt_print.c` stands in for it with a round-trip search over `%.*e`. Correct, and slow: up to 18 `snprintf`+`strtod` pairs per number printed. See plan-notes 28 for the standing seam and plan-notes 188 for the correction: the network IS reachable, so Ryū is fetchable and simply not yet fetched — a scheduling fact, not an environmental one. **The schedule is now recorded** (owner's call, 2026-09-04, plan-notes 190): Ryū rides the §12 optimization ladder rather than becoming a task, because the corpus it would replace already matches Node byte-for-byte, so it is a pure speed change and §12's entry criterion — a measured before/after on Task 6.3's harness — applies. (This line claimed Ryū was vendored until 2026-09-01.)
- **Test262 corpus** — fetched on demand (`pnpm run test262:fetch`) into `tests/test262/corpus/` or `$STATOR_TEST262`. The runner, pin, and ratchet are in-tree; `pnpm run test262` is a CI heartbeat, not part of `pnpm run ci`.
  - **Pool width (`STATOR_TEST_JOBS`)** — `packages/tests/support/parallel.ts` runs compile/execute work on a fixed-size pool. Default width is `os.availableParallelism()` (one slot per logical core). Set `STATOR_TEST_JOBS=N` to override: raise it on a quiet machine with headroom, lower it (`1` forces serial) when debugging a flaky failure or when sharing a CI box that must not be saturated.
  - **Results JSON** — compact by default; `--pretty-results` or `STATOR_TEST262_PRETTY=1` for indented output. `STATOR_TEST262_WRITE_RESULTS=0` skips writing the big file for local scratch (CI shards must still write — leave unset there).
