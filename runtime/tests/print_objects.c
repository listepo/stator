/* print_objects.c — prints a fixed corpus of class instances through jsrt_print.
 *
 * Ground truth is Node, not a table written here: runtime/tests/print_objects.mjs builds the SAME
 * objects in the same order and prints them with console.log; `just runtime-test` diffs the two
 * byte-for-byte. Keep the two corpora in the same order or the diff means nothing.
 *
 * What this file has to pin, beyond "it prints the fields": the class NAME prints in front and
 * counts toward the 80-column budget, so the same fields under a longer name break onto separate
 * lines; there is no column grouping (eight fields are eight lines where eight array elements
 * would be a grid); and past the depth cap an object prints as `[ClassName]`, not `[Object]`.
