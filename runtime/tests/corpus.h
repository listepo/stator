/* corpus.h — the two constructors every print corpus writes literals with.
 *
 * Each `print_*.c` builds a fixed list of values and prints them, and each one needs a number and a
 * string from a C literal. They live here rather than three times over so that "what a corpus value
 * is" has one definition: a corpus is only ground truth while the C side and the `.mjs` side build
 * the SAME values, and a helper that drifted in one file would break that quietly.
