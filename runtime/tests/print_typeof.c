/* print_typeof.c — prints `typeof` for one value of every shape the runtime has.
 *
 * Ground truth is Node, not a table written here: runtime/tests/print_typeof.mjs asks the same
 * questions in the same order and prints the answers with console.log; `just runtime-test` diffs
 * the two byte-for-byte. Keep the two corpora in the same order or the diff means nothing.
 *
 * `typeof` is where the runtime's tags and the language's answers disagree twice, and both are
 * pinned here by consequence rather than by assertion. `typeof null` is "object" — the 1995 bug
 * that became normative, and the one answer no structural route to the tag would give. And a
 * closure answers "function" even though jsrt_is_object says it IS an object, which is the single
 * place in this runtime where callable is a category of its own.
 *
 * The numeric cases exist because NaN-boxing makes "is this a number" a two-tag question: a value
 * is a number if it is an unboxed double OR carries the int32 tag, and a real NaN reaches the tag
 * switch as a double rather than as one of the tagged values living in the quiet-NaN space.
