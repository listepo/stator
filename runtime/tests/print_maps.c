/* print_maps.c — prints a fixed corpus of Maps and Sets through jsrt_print.
 *
 * Ground truth is Node, not a table written here: runtime/tests/print_maps.mjs builds the SAME
 * collections in the same order and prints them with console.log; `make -C runtime test` diffs the
 * two byte-for-byte. Keep the two corpora in the same order or the diff means nothing.
 *
 * Beyond "it prints the entries", this pins the three things a Map is easy to get wrong: the
 * `Map(n)` prefix counts toward the 80-column budget the way a class name does, entries print in
 * INSERTION order (with a re-set key keeping its place and a deleted key vacating it), and there is
 * no column grouping, so eight numbers in a Set are eight lines where eight in an array are a grid.
 *
 * The key rules are checked by CONSEQUENCE rather than by asserting on the table: a NaN key that
 * did not hash to itself, or a -0 that did not find +0, changes what this program prints.
