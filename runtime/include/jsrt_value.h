 * cache work: "same shape" implies "same offset", so a hit is one pointer compare and one load.
 *
 * A shape is one link of that history: `parent` is the object's shape before `key` was added, and
 * `offset` is the slot the addition claimed, so a shape's slot count is `offset + 1` and the root
 * (no properties yet) is the one shape with a NULL key. Transitions -- "from this shape, adding
 * this key leads to that shape" -- hang off the parent as a linked list of children. Shapes are
