/* jsrt_date.c — `Date`, slice A: the TZ-INDEPENDENT core (plan.md §7 Task 4.2).
 *
 * A Date is one double: milliseconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z, or NaN for an Invalid Date. Every
 * operation here is a pure function of that double, which is exactly what makes this slice
 * testable by ordinary golden tests — no clock is read, no timezone database is consulted, and the
 * output on any machine is the output on the pinned Node. The local-time half (`getHours` and its
 * siblings, `getTimezoneOffset`) is slice B, and `Date.now`/`new Date()` read a clock and land
 * under the determinism carve-out. `toString`/`toLocale*` need CLDR names and belong to the intl
 * feature build (Task 4.4).
 *
 * The calendar arithmetic is Howard Hinnant's `days_from_civil`/`civil_from_days` (the algorithms
 * behind C++20's <chrono>), which are exact over the proleptic Gregorian calendar for every year a
 * time value can reach. ECMA-262 §21.4.1 defines the same calendar, so this is a translation
 * rather than an approximation: 1900 is not a leap year here, 2000 is, and year 0 exists.
