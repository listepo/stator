 * is popped on the way out — is a property of the GENERATED C, decided by the emitter where the
 * scope structure is known, not of the runtime, which cannot see scopes at all. The runtime's
 * whole contribution is a mailbox the unwind protocol reads; the protocol itself is documented
 * at the declarations in jsrt_value.h.
