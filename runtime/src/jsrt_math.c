/* Math builtins (plan.md §7 Task 4.2) — number -> number, ECMA-262 §21.3.2 exactly.
 *
 * Three groups live here, and which group a member is in decides where its answer comes from:
 *
 * 1. IEEE-defined (floor/ceil/trunc/abs/sqrt): the host libm is REQUIRED to be correct, so it is
 *    called directly. round, sign, min, max and pow's special cases are where ECMA and C89's libm
 *    disagree, and each wrapper below exists for a named disagreement.
 * 2. Approximated transcendentals (sin, log, exp, cbrt, …): the host libm is ALLOWED to differ in
 *    the last ulp, and measurably does — up to 41% of random inputs disagree with Node (plan-notes
 *    117). They go to the vendored fdlibm, which is the same code V8 runs, so agreement with Node
 *    is structural rather than lucky. This is what `vendor/fdlibm/` exists for.
 * 3. Not in fdlibm at all (hypot, random): V8 implements these itself, so we mirror V8's own
 *    algorithm — see each function's comment.
 *
 * Everything here takes and returns boxed values, canonicalized by jsrt_number like every other
 * producer — arguments are typed `number` by the frontend, and inside checked code annotations
 * are trusted fully (golden rule 4 is about boundaries, and there is none here). */
