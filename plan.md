# plan.md — Stator: a two-mode AOT compiler for TypeScript/JavaScript

> **Audience:** AI agents (and humans) executing this project. This file is self-contained: read it top to bottom before doing any task. Every task has numbered **Steps** and a **Check** — do not mark a task done until its Check passes. Findings that contradict this plan go into `plan-notes.md` (repo root), not silently into code. Operational conventions (commands, coding standards, workflow) live in `AGENTS.md`; this file is the roadmap and the spec.
>
> **Name:** **Stator** (formerly "Ketch" — renamed 2026-08-29; "Ketch" collides with an established company). A stator is the static half of an electric motor: it doesn't move, and it's what makes the rotor spin. The compiler's two modes mirror stator/rotor — the static `ts` mode and the dynamic `js` mode. CLI binary: `stator`.
>
> **Source research:** "The JS AOT Field Guide" (five multi-agent research fan-outs, 2026-08-28/29, ~700 web lookups): prior art (30+ projects incl. graveyard), Static Hermes vs Perry vs Porffor vs scriptc head-to-head, FFI survey, JS→Rust-target rejection, engine-embedding costs, Boa internals deep-dive. Competitor performance figures below are self-published — treat as directional, re-benchmark locally.
>
> **Verification:** v1.1 was adversarially reviewed by three independent checker agents; all 24 findings folded in. v2.0 is a directed pivot (implementation language, modes, rename) — see §16.

## 0. Prime directives (read before anything)

1. **Compile a typed subset. Never attempt untyped, full-semantics JS→native via static analysis.** Every dead project in the field (JSSAT, NectarJS, TSLL, ts2c…) tried to statically compile untyped JS with full semantics; every living one (Static Hermes, Perry, Porffor, scriptc) compiles a typed or restricted subset and is explicit about what it drops. Path explosion in abstract interpretation of untyped JS is what killed JSSAT. In Stator, untyped code is handled by *dynamic representation at runtime* (tagged values, shapes, inline caches) or the Phase-8 interpreter tier — never by heroic static analysis.
2. **TypeScript types are unsound. Never trust an annotation without a boundary check.** `as` casts, out-of-date `.d.ts` files, bivariant method params, and `JSON.parse` all let lies into the type system. Trust types *inside* checked code; insert runtime checks wherever untyped/external values enter (Static Hermes model).
3. **Don't write a parser. Don't write a type checker.** The compiler is TypeScript, so use the `typescript` npm package **in-process**: `ts.createProgram(...)` for parsing + module graph, `program.getTypeChecker()` for types. Lower directly from the TS AST (`ts.Node`) — no ESTree conversion layer. Do **not** build on `tsgo`/TypeScript 7's compiler API (explicitly incomplete as of the TS 7.0 RC) — re-evaluate quarterly in `plan-notes.md`.
4. **Emit C first, LLVM IR later.** Static Hermes, Porffor, and scriptc all print C: easier debugging, `#line` source mapping for free, clang does the heavy optimization. A direct LLVM backend is a later optimization (and can be plain `.ll` text emission — no bindings needed), not a starting point.
5. **Never emit Rust, and don't use Rust anywhere in this project.** Rust-as-target was measured and rejected (dyn-dispatch overhead, DSTs, `Rc<RefCell>` aliasing, slow borrow-check on generated megafiles). The compiler is TypeScript; the runtime is **C11 with a Zig memory core** (plan-notes 238 / T9.1). Generated code stays C. The C11-only runtime was reopened on the creator's direction, not measured evidence — C11-only returns only on the same kind of direction. No FFI between compiler components. **Zig rule (creator's direction 2026-10-02, plan-notes 289):** new runtime code that manages memory or must be cross-platform — typed-array storage, the `std` backings, the event loop, OS abstraction — is written in Zig. C stays for the C ABI headers generated code includes (`jsrt.h`, `jsrt_value.h`), for generated code, for vendored upstream code, and for existing C until a card ports it. No wholesale port of the C runtime without a card.
6. **The runtime is the moat, not the codegen.** GC, builtins coverage, strings, RegExp, and ICU are where the years go. Budget accordingly; tree-shake builtins from day 1.
7. **Allocation dominates, not dispatch.** Boa's Cranelift JIT experiment proved it: 10× on numeric loops, <5% on allocation-bound benchmarks; GC tracing 10–16% of time, dispatch only ~13%. This ordering drives the optimization ladder (§12).
8. **One pipeline, two modes.** A mode is a *policy layer* (which files are accepted, which constructs are errors, how untyped code is typed) over one shared pipeline. If a feature seems to require forking the pipeline per mode, the design is wrong — stop and fix the design (usually: the feature belongs to the dynamic representation or the Phase-8 tier).
9. **The compiler itself is strict TypeScript.** Locked `tsconfig` (§4 Task 1.0), no `any` in compiler source, vitest for unit tests (dev-only, run on Node's own type stripping — plan-notes 285), runtime dependency budget: the `typescript` package only — **owner-directed exception (2026-09-04, plan-notes 187):** `src/cli/` may use ink + react (human-facing rendering plus per-command help, long-form flags) and dotenv (environment loading), and `typebox` + `jsonc-parser` for `stator.config.json` (`src/cli/config.ts` only, plan-notes 303), and OpenTelemetry tracing (`@opentelemetry/*`, opt-in via `STATOR_OTEL`, standard OTLP env config — works with Maple and any OTLP backend) is wired through `src/support/telemetry.ts`; execa is dev-only for `tests/unit/cli.test.ts`. The budget still rules everything else: no pass, lowering, or codegen code may depend on these. The compiler must always pass its own `ts` mode's *philosophy*: fully typed, no dynamic escape hatches.
10. **No JavaScript in the project's own source** (creator's direction 2026-10-02, plan-notes 289). The compiler, runtime, `std`, the `node:*` wrappers, test harnesses, oracle shims and scripts are strict TypeScript, C or Zig. `.js` / `.mjs` / `.cjs` files exist only as: `js`-mode test inputs and examples (the thing under test), vendored upstream code, generated output, and assets a browser loads as-is (`site/public/`). The existing harness `.mjs` files migrate under §9 Task 6.15.

**Non-goals (v1):** npm-ecosystem compatibility (Phase 11 targets Node *programs* such as `tsc`, not the npm ecosystem at large); `eval`/`new Function` (never in `ts` mode; `js` mode not before Phase 8); `Proxy`; `with`; prototype mutation after construction; decorators; full Intl; Node API emulation outside Phase 11's `--node` platform (§11c); Windows (POSIX + clang first); self-hosting the compiler.

---

## 1. Product spec — the two modes

This section is the requirement source. `docs/MODES.md` and `docs/SUBSET.md` (delivered in Phase 1) operationalize it; they may add detail but may not contradict it without a §15-protocol plan edit.

### 1.1 `--mode=ts` (default) — strict static TypeScript

- **Inputs:** `.ts` files only. Any `.js`/`.jsx`/`.tsx` file anywhere in the module graph is a compile error (`STA1002`) with the hint "use `--mode=js`". (`.tsx` is out of scope for v1 in both modes.)
- **Typing:** the program must type-check under the strict settings Stator imposes (Stator owns `compilerOptions`; a user `tsconfig.json` contributes at most `paths`/`lib` details). Implicit `any` is an error. **Explicit `any` and `as any` are errors** (`STA1001`) — use `unknown` and narrow. This is the mode's contract: it may trust types precisely because it forbids the lies.
- **Dynamic escape hatches are compile errors, permanently** (distinct "never" diagnostics, not "not yet"): `eval` (`STA1101`), `new Function` (`STA1103`), `Proxy`, prototype mutation (`Object.setPrototypeOf`, writing `__proto__`), `delete` on class fields, `arguments`, `with` (illegal in ESM anyway), `var`, CommonJS `require`.
- **Everything else that is typed TS should eventually compile.** The long-term target is: `ts` mode coverage grows toward "all of type-checked TypeScript minus the closed list above". Gaps on the way are "not yet" diagnostics naming the phase that delivers them.
- **Sound-by-boundary:** values from `unknown`, unions, `JSON.parse`, and FFI are represented as tagged values and runtime-checked at the point of narrowing (§2 value representation). Fully-typed code compiles to raw machine values.

### 1.2 `--mode=js` — JavaScript, and JS + TS mixed

- **Inputs:** any mix of `.js` and `.ts` in one module graph (still ESM-only, still strict mode — sloppy mode and `with` are errors in both modes because ESM is always strict).
- **Typing:** `.ts` files are type-checked and get the static treatment exactly as in `ts` mode (except `any` is *allowed* here and lowers to the dynamic representation). `.js` files are loaded with `allowJs` + `checkJs`-style inference: whatever the checker can infer (including from JSDoc annotations — a freebie from the TS checker) is used to stay on the static path; everything else lowers to the dynamic representation (tagged values + shape tables + inline caches). **No errors for untyped code** — untyped means dynamic, not rejected.
- **JS-only constructs compile:** `var` (function-scoped, hoisted, initialized `undefined`), loose equality `==`/`!=` (full ToPrimitive coercion on the dynamic path), untyped object literals, heterogeneous arrays.
- **`eval`/`new Function`:** "not yet" diagnostic (`STA1206`) until Phase 8 lands the interpreter tier; then supported in `js` mode only.
- **Mixed-graph boundaries:** when a value flows from a `.js` module into typed `.ts` code, the declared/inferred type at the import site is enforced by a runtime boundary check — the same machinery as `unknown` narrowing. A lying JSDoc or wrong inference produces a runtime type error with a source location, not memory corruption.

### 1.3 Mode mechanics (both modes)

- Mode is a CLI flag: `stator build <entry> -o <out> [--mode=ts|js]`. Default is `ts`. No inference magic: a `.js` entry under the default mode is `STA1002` with a hint, not a silent mode switch.
- Every diagnostic carries a stable code (`STA` + 4 digits, `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md`), the mode, and a source span. `--diagnostics=json` emits machine-readable output. "Never" codes and "not yet" codes are disjoint ranges so tests can tell intent from schedule.
- `stator explain <entry> --mode=... --json` reports the file verdict `static | dynamic | error(CODE) | not-yet(CODE)`, every diagnostic of the stage that decided it, and the static/dynamic split per function (`docs/MODES.md` §6; plan-notes 291). This is how decision tests (§4 Task 1.4) verify the matrix, and how users audit what went dynamic.
- One pipeline: mode influences (a) file acceptance, (b) the diagnostic table, (c) whether unresolved types are an error (`ts`) or lower to `Unknown` (`js`). Nothing downstream of HIR knows the mode existed.

        for eval/untyped modules (Phase 8, js mode only)
```

`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` renders this section as D2 diagrams (component, sequence, package,
value-flow views) sourced from `docs/architecture/*.d2`. It is a visualization of this section, never an authority over it.

**Repo layout (fixed):**

```
plan.md AGENTS.md plan-notes.md NICHE.md          # root (pnpm workspace + .moon/; plan-notes 204)
docs/    ARCHITECTURE.md architecture/*.d2 MODES.md SUBSET.md DIAGNOSTICS.md VALUE.md NUMERIC.md HIR.md TOOLCHAIN.md
packages/compiler/  src/{cli,frontend,hir,lower,passes,codegen,support}  (package "statorc" + locked tsconfig)
packages/runtime/   include/jsrt_value.h  src/ (C11 + Zig memory core, T9.1)  vendor/  (justfile)   → packages/runtime/build/libjsrt.a
packages/tests/     unit/  subset/  golden/ts/  golden/js/  differential/  bench/  (package "@stator/tests")
```

The three packages sit under a private pnpm workspace and are orchestrated by moon (`.moon/`); `pnpm run ci` stays the serial gate and `moon run tests:ci` mirrors it as a cached graph (plan-notes 204). The pipeline below is unchanged by the move.

**HType — the internal type model.** Never pass `ts.Type` beyond `src/frontend/`. `src/hir/types.ts` defines a small, serializable, structural type model (`number`, `i32`-refinement, `string`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `fn(params, ret)`, `array<T>`, `object-shape`, `map/set specializations`, `union`, `generic-instance`, `Unknown`). `src/frontend/types.ts` is the only module that maps `ts.Type → HType`; anything the checker can't resolve maps to `Unknown` (with an `implicit-any` flag) — never a guess. `docs/HIR.md` documents the mapping with ≥10 worked examples (generic instantiation, union widening, JSDoc-inferred, `JSON.parse`, `.d.ts` import, method bivariance…). In `ts` mode, `Unknown`-from-implicit-`any` is an error at the gate; in `js` mode it's the dynamic path.

**Value representation** — 64-bit NaN-boxing (the JSC/QuickJS/Boa-v0.21 consensus; Boa reported double-digit speed and memory wins moving from an enum to NaN-boxing — re-establish on our own benchmarks). Doubles are themselves; quiet-NaN space encodes tag (3 bits) + 48-bit payload: `Int32 | Ptr(Object|String|Array|Closure) | Bool | Null | Undefined`. `docs/VALUE.md` must be written **before any codegen** (Phase 2 Task 2.1) and must specify:
- the exact bit layout, including how `-0.0` survives (it is a valid double, not a boxed int — `Object.is(-0, 0) === false` is a decision test);
- the **string struct**: `struct JSString { uint32_t length; uint16_t data[]; }` — UTF-16 code units (JS semantics: `.length`, `charCodeAt`, Test262 assume it; do not choose UTF-8 for v0), accessed from generated C only via `jsrt_string_length(v)` / `jsrt_string_char(v, i)` inline accessors;
- **number→string is spec-exact**: shortest-round-trip formatting (vendor Ryū's C implementation), byte-identical to Node. Never "round to N decimals" to paper over differences;
- the **GC rooting protocol** (needed by the *first* line of generated C): every generated function opens a `JSRT_FRAME(n)` shadow-stack frame; every local holding a `jsrt_value` or heap pointer is declared through `JSRT_LOCAL(frame, i)`; frames pop on every exit path *including landing pads*. Under Boehm (conservative) the macros may compile to almost nothing — the discipline exists so §12's precise generational GC is a runtime-only change, never a codegen rewrite. (Boa's history: retrofitting precise GC onto undisciplined codegen means rewriting codegen.)

**Statics that are actually typed compile to raw machine values** (unboxed i32/f64/struct fields) — boxing only at boundaries. This is where the 10–20× over interpreters comes from (Static Hermes evidence).

**Errors/exceptions:** return-value + landing-pad style in generated C (`if (jsrt_pending()) goto catch_1;`) — not setjmp/longjmp (bad codegen interactions, GC-root issues). Every landing pad runs the scope's cleanup (shadow-stack frame pops in reverse scope order) before jumping; frame bookkeeping on unwind paths is mandatory and ASan/UBSan-tested (§6 Task 3.10).

**Estimates in this plan are effort, not deadlines.** They exist for sequencing and risk decisions; an agent must never cut a Check to "stay on schedule."

---

## 3. Phase 0 — Go/no-go gate (human decision)

> **Status: ✅ CLOSED 2026-09-01.** `NICHE.md` exists and carries the owner's explicit approval;
> the commit that added it is tagged `phase-0-approved`. Evidence: [done.md](done.md) → Phase 0.
> The steps below stay here because they are the gate's own definition, and §15.1's rule — that no
> phase may be entered without its gate — is enforced by pointing at them.

~~**Task 0.1 — Build-vs-join check.**~~ ✅

Steps:
1. Re-read the field summary in §0.1. The four funded-or-active players: Static Hermes, Perry, Porffor, scriptc. A new compiler is justified only by a niche they don't serve.
2. Write `NICHE.md` (repo root) naming the chosen niche, the competitor that almost serves it, and why they don't. Candidate niches from the research: **TS-native tooling binaries** (scriptc's lane — barely started, a Vercel Labs experiment); **WasmGC output** (Wasmnizer-ts's lane — "do not use in production", weakly held); **a two-mode compiler with a real JS story** (Stator's differentiator: nobody serves "strict TS binaries *and* your existing untyped JS in one tool"); or another concrete gap written down with evidence.
3. Confirm embedding isn't sufficient: if the real requirement is "users can script my app," **stop — embed a JS engine** (QuickJS-NG: hours of work, ~1.3 MB, <300 µs startup) or use WASM plugins (Zed/Lapce model). The compiler is only justified by: typed-code performance no interpreter reaches, tiny standalone binaries, or JIT-banned platforms.
4. Present `NICHE.md` to the human owner. **An agent must not self-approve this gate.**
5. On explicit human approval: commit, tag `phase-0-approved`.

**Check (machine-verifiable, and re-runnable at any later HEAD):** `NICHE.md` exists with the three
required elements (a human read of the file, recorded in `done.md`), and
`git cat-file -e phase-0-approved:NICHE.md` exits 0 — which fails unless the tag resolves *and* the
commit it names carries the file. The stronger form, if the provenance is ever doubted:
`git log --diff-filter=A --format=%H phase-0-approved -- NICHE.md` equals
`git rev-parse phase-0-approved^{commit}`, i.e. the tagged commit is the one that ADDED the file.

> Not `git describe --tags --exact-match HEAD`, which this Check used to specify. That asks "is HEAD
> the approval commit", which was true for exactly one commit and has been false ever since — a
> closed gate reporting itself open at every later HEAD (plan-notes 135).

---

## 4. Phase 1 — Bootstrap and specifications ✅ COMPLETE (2026-08-29)

All four tasks done, both Checks passed. **Evidence: [done.md](done.md) → Phase 1.** Deviations are
logged in `plan-notes.md` (entries 1–20). Titles stay here so `§4 Task 1.N` references resolve:

- ~~**Task 1.0** — Bootstrap the TypeScript workspace.~~ ✅
- ~~**Task 1.1** — Write `docs/SUBSET.md`: the feature × mode matrix.~~ ✅
- ~~**Task 1.2** — Write `docs/MODES.md`.~~ ✅
- ~~**Task 1.3** — Write `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md`.~~ ✅
- ~~**Task 1.4** — Decision tests + conventions.~~ ✅

**Settled 2026-09-04 (plan-notes 190, closing notes #9):** the Node pin is **26.7.0** and stays
there. Task 1.0 step 2's wording was "current Node LTS" and 26.x is Current, but the pin has been
the differential ground truth since 2026-08-29 and three artefacts are now measured against it —
146 golden fixtures byte-for-byte, the Test262 ratchet, and `tests/bench/baseline.json`. Moving to
24.x re-baselines all three to satisfy a word, and Node 26 enters LTS this October regardless.
`.node-version` and `mise.toml` already agree; nothing changes but the question. (The "nothing is
committed yet" follow-up is closed: the tree
has been committed since 2026-08-30. **Phase 0 is now closed too** — `NICHE.md` was approved by the
owner on 2026-09-01 and its commit is tagged `phase-0-approved`, so the §15.1 exception that let
Phase 1 run ahead of it no longer has anything to except.)

The **locked `tsconfig.json`** this phase produced is normative and lives here, not in `done.md`
(§15.7 — changes require a plan edit):

   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "strict": true,
       "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
       "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true,
       "noImplicitOverride": true,
       "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
       "noUnusedLocals": true,
       "noUnusedParameters": true,
       "isolatedModules": true,
       "verbatimModuleSyntax": true,
       "erasableSyntaxOnly": true,
       "allowImportingTsExtensions": true,
       "rewriteRelativeImportExtensions": true,
       "module": "nodenext",
       "moduleResolution": "nodenext",
       "target": "es2023",
       "lib": ["es2023"],
       "types": ["node"],
       "rootDir": "src",
       "outDir": "dist",
       "sourceMap": true,
       "skipLibCheck": true
     },
     "include": ["src"]
   }
   ```
   (`erasableSyntaxOnly` bans `enum`/`namespace`/parameter properties in our own source — required for Node's type stripping and house style anyway: use `const` objects + union types. The two `*ImportExtensions` flags are what let one source tree both run under Node's type stripping in dev — where relative imports must name the real `.ts` file — and emit runnable JS into `dist/`; see `plan-notes.md` 2026-08-29 #3.)
   A second project, `tests/tsconfig.json`, extends this one (`noEmit`, `rootDir: "."`) to cover `tests/**/*.ts`, excluding the deliberately-invalid fixture directories (`subset/subset_*`, `golden/ts`, `golden/js`, `differential`). It exists because the locked config above is `src`-only, which leaves test sources unchecked. It adds no leniency.
   The lint/format config (`.oxlintrc.json` + `.oxfmtrc.json` — format checking folded into `lint`, warnings escalated; oxlint replaces the Biome of plan-notes 19, plan-notes 224), the `src/` skeleton (whose `build`/`explain` report honest not-implemented diagnostics), the justfile, the npm scripts, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and `./ci.sh` (the CI until a remote exists) are all in place — the files themselves are now the reference; AGENTS.md carries the command list.

---

## 5. Phase 2 — Walking skeleton, end to end ✅ COMPLETE (2026-08-29)

Smallest full pipeline (`ts` mode only), shipped before making any part good. **Evidence:
[done.md](done.md) → Phase 2.** Titles stay here so `§5 Task 2.N` references resolve:

- ~~**Task 2.1** — Write `docs/VALUE.md` first.~~ ✅
- ~~**Task 2.2** — Micro-frontend.~~ ✅
- ~~**Task 2.3** — Micro-HIR + verifier.~~ ✅
- ~~**Task 2.4** — C emitter + driver.~~ ✅
- ~~**Task 2.5** — Runtime v0 (C11).~~ ✅
- ~~**Task 2.6** — Golden-test harness.~~ ✅
- ~~**Task 2.7** — CI hardening.~~ ✅

---

## 6. Phase 3 — Typed HIR and the lowering ladder ✅ COMPLETE (2026-08-30)

Every task and all eight rungs of the ladder landed; the phase exit ran a 477-line five-module
transit route planner byte-for-byte against Node. **Evidence: [done.md](done.md) → Phase 3.** Titles
stay here so `§6 Task 3.N` references resolve:

- ~~**Task 3.1** — HIR design doc (`docs/HIR.md`).~~ ✅
- ~~**Task 3.2** — `docs/NUMERIC.md` — numeric semantics contract.~~ ✅
- ~~**Task 3.3** — The lowering ladder.~~ ✅ — rungs: 1 arithmetic · 2 strings + template literals ·
  3 control flow · 4 functions + closures (4a calls, 4b captures) · 5 arrays · 6 classes (6a layout,
  6b accessors/override/statics) · 7 `Map`/`Set` · 8 `for`-`of`.
- ~~**Task 3.4** — Monomorphization.~~ ✅
- ~~**Task 3.5** — Boundary-check insertion.~~ ✅
- ~~**Tasks 3.6–3.9** — Optimization passes v0 (const-fold, DCE/tree-shake, inline).~~ ✅
- ~~**Task 3.10** — Exception unwinding.~~ ✅
- ~~**Task 3.11** — Modules.~~ ✅
- ~~**Task 3.12** — Tree-shaking builtins.~~ ✅

---

## 7. Phase 4 — Runtime v1 ✅ COMPLETE (2026-09-01)

All seven tasks landed and the phase's exit criterion — added mid-flight because the phase had a
Check but no scope boundary (plan-notes 116) — is met on every bullet. `pnpm run ci` green:
319 unit tests, 272 subset fixtures (209 passed, 63 expected-fail, 0 failed), **93 golden fixtures
byte-for-byte against the pinned Node under both the release and the ASan/UBSan runtime**, the
10M-object leak loop plateauing at 3.0 MB RSS, and the builtins dashboard rendering.
**Evidence: [done.md](done.md) → Phase 4.** Titles stay here so `§7 Task 4.N` references resolve:

- ~~**Task 4.1** — Objects.~~ ✅ — shapes, inline caches, and the array-with-properties slice.
- ~~**Task 4.2** — Builtins, driven by golden tests.~~ ✅ — `Math`, `JSON`, `String.prototype`,
  `Array.prototype`, `Object`, `Map`, `Set`, `console`, `Date`. A builtin counted as implemented
  when ≥1 golden test exercised it and matched Node, with a **determinism carve-out** for members
  that cannot match by construction (`Math.random`, `Date.now`, zero-argument `new Date()`,
  `console.time`/`timeEnd`/`trace`), which prove by shape assertion in `tests/unit/` instead.
- ~~**Task 4.3** — RegExp.~~ ✅ — QuickJS-NG `libregexp` vendored; `libunicode` paid `toUpperCase`/
  `toLowerCase`/`normalize`'s debt with it.
- ~~**Task 4.4** — Intl/ICU.~~ ✅ — a feature build (`just runtime-intl`), off by default.
- ~~**Task 4.5** — GC hygiene tests.~~ ✅
- ~~**Task 4.6** — `async`/`await`.~~ ✅ — generators split off to Phase 5 step 8, which owns the
  iterator protocol they actually wait on.
- ~~**Task 4.7** — Audit every not-yet phase pointer.~~ ✅ — and it is why this phase could close
  honestly: 165 sites re-derived, 70 of which named a phase that had been complete for six days,
  every one now naming the phase that owns its blocker, with `tests/unit/phases.test.ts` failing
  the build if that ever stops being true (plan-notes 136, §15 rule 9).

**What is still missing from the dashboard is missing on purpose**, and each residue names its
owner: `Object`'s `freeze`/`isFrozen` and the `Promise` prototype → Phase 5 step 11;
`keys`/`values`/`entries`, `for`-`of` over non-arrays, `function*` and `String.prototype.matchAll`
→ Phase 5 step 8; the descriptor/prototype surface and `RegExp.prototype.compile` → Phase 8; the
five ICU-dependent `Date` string forms → the intl feature build, which is a flag rather than a
phase. The dashboard counts MEMBERS, not blockers, so a percentage below 100 is not open work

## 8. Phase 5 — `js` mode, and the language surface Phases 3 and 4 deferred (est. +4–6 weeks; needs Phase 4's shapes/ICs)

Until here, every pipeline stage was built `ts`-mode-first but mode-agnostic below the gate (§0.8). This phase turns on the second policy.

The title gained its second half on 2026-09-01 (plan-notes 116) and its "3 and" on the same day
(plan-notes 136). Steps 8–12 are not `js`-mode work: they are language surface that needs one more
mechanism, which an earlier phase deferred without naming an owner. They are here because the
mechanism each one waits on is **lowering** work, not runtime work, and Phases 3 and 4 closed on
the rungs and the runtime respectively, not on the surface they deferred.

**Split trigger (armed 2026-09-01, plan-notes 136).** The earlier wording — *"if this phase starts
feeling like a bucket"* — was a feeling, and step 12 arrived carrying 70 gate sites on its own, more
than steps 8–11 combined. Feeling is now replaced by a condition: **split steps 8–12 into their own
phase the moment step 12's construct families stop landing as one dependency chain** — concretely,
when two of its families are being worked by different people at once, or when the step's own Check
has to be split to report progress. Do it by plan edit (§15.3), not by drift, and take a new phase
NUMBER rather than renumbering 6/7/8, which `plan.md §N` citations in code comments and `docs/`
depend on.

Steps (1–11 detailed 2026-09-01 against the live substrate; plan-notes 131. Step 12 was added the
same day from Task 4.7's inventory; plan-notes 136). **Steps 1–11 have landed**; their evidence is
in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5. Numbers and titles stay here so `§8 step N` references resolve.
<What is still OPEN in this phase is **step 12 (c)–(f)** residue — steps 2a(b) and 2a(c)
are both closed (all three (b) buckets landed per plan-notes 272; both (c) buckets landed per
plan-notes 277), and the twenty-one steps 18–38 added by the 2026-09-14 bug hunt
(plan-notes 249–251) plus steps 39–46 added after it have all landed (struck stubs below;
evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5). The two
shipped-construct defects the bug hunt of 2026-09-11 found (steps 15 and 16) both landed the same
day — plan-notes 225 and 226.
Step 13 was added and landed on 2026-09-04 (plan-notes 193); step 14 was added on 2026-09-09
(plan-notes 209) and landed on 2026-09-11 (plan-notes 216). Tags below carry both legends (§14):
difficulty as `[Dn]`, priority as `[Pn]`, and where a task's steps disagree the task keeps the
highest of them — which is also how the heading reads (`D2 · P1` is the lowest difficulty and the
highest priority among the items below, not the phase's own shape). Step 2a(c) is `[D4][P0]` — it is
the shared blocker the (b) sweep ended at, so every further suppression decision waits on the
question it asks rather than on another bucket judgment. Step 2a(b)'s three remaining buckets are
`[D2][P1]` and **blocked** on step 12's surface, which is why they are not P0 as well. Step 15 is
`[D4][P1]` — a defect in a construct Stator already ships and already claims to compile, the
`await`-in-a-loop one being a SIGTRAP at `-O2`. Step 16 was the second such defect when this tagging
pass began and landed during it, which is why it now carries no tag (§14: struck-through work does
not).

~~**Step-12 bookkeeping debt** (added 2026-09-04; closed 2026-09-08, all three sub-items in one
bundle — evidence: done.md → Phase 5).~~ ✅

1. ~~Frontend: `allowJs` + `checkJs`-style inference in the `ts.Program`; per-function
   "typed | inferred | dynamic" provenance recorded into HIR.~~ ✅ **landed** (2026-09-01,
   plan-notes 140) — the grade answers what the AUTHOR wrote, not which file it lives in.
2. ~~Gate: switch the diagnostic table by mode — `any`/`as any` lowers to `Unknown` in `js`, `var`
   becomes legal there, a `.js` entry under `ts` stays `STA1002`, and `eval`/`new Function` emit
   `STA1206` not-yet Phase 8 while `ts` keeps `STA1101`/`STA1103` never.~~ ✅ **landed**
   (2026-09-02, plan-notes 141).
2a. **Step 2's other half: the `compilerOptions`, not just the diagnostic table** (added 2026-09-03
   from Task 6.1's first corpus pass; plan-notes 175–176). Step 2 switched *which diagnostics the
   gate emits* by mode and never audited *what Stator asks the checker to enforce* against the same
   contract. §1.2 is one sentence — untyped code is never rejected — and several Stator-owned
   checker settings break it by refusing code that is not untyped at all, just not TypeScript.
   `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch` and `useUnknownInCatchVariables` are already fixed (they are now
   `mode === 'ts'`); Test262 found them because no decision fixture had asked, both being things
   nobody writes deliberately in TypeScript. What is left, in measured order:
   ~~(a) **The possibly-null family** (2531/2532/2533, 2721/2722/2723, 18047/18048/18049).~~
   ✅ **landed 2026-09-03** (plan-notes 180).
   (b) The rest of the `STA0012` buckets, each judged individually against §1.2 rather than as a
   group — some are real refusals Stator should keep. The bucket sizes are the measurement taken
   after (a); four have since landed and are struck through:
   ~~3233 `Argument of type 'X' is not assignable to parameter of type 'X'`~~ ✅ 2026-09-03
   (plan-notes 185) · **1326 `Cannot find name 'X'`** · ~~468 `Type 'X' is not assignable to type
   'X'`~~ ✅ 2026-09-03 (plan-notes 184) · **408 `implicitly has an 'any' type`** · ~~265 arity~~
   ✅ 2026-09-03 (plan-notes 183) **+ 183 arity still open** · ~~235 `left-hand side of an
   arithmetic operation`~~ ✅ 2026-09-03 (plan-notes 186) · **196 `No overload matches this call`**.
   Across the five landings the Test262 ratchet moved **10,513 → 7276 failed** and
   **40,688 → 43,925 skipped** with `passed` unchanged at **2379** throughout — the tests did not
   start passing, they moved from a checker lint to Stator's own schedule (the `STA12xx` skip
   column), which is the attribution §1.3's disjoint ranges exist to make. Per-landing evidence:
   [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5 step 2a.
   ~~The remaining buckets were swept 2026-09-04; four more codes landed (18050, 2403, 2695,
   8024/8029) and the strict-mode family was judged a **real refusal Stator keeps**.~~
   ✅ **the sweep is complete** (plan-notes 194, 196) — evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5
   step 2a. **All three (b) buckets have landed since** (plan-notes 272): 2683 went in as the
   OPTION `noImplicitThis: mode === 'ts'` (done.md → Phase 5 wave 4, dynamic `this`), 2769 as the
   overload-fallback acceptance (done.md → wave 4), and 2464 as a js-mode suppression with
   dynamic-path coercion. (b) is closed; the override-widening bucket it never named (TS2416,
   plan-notes 68) is owned by step 12(d). What is left after
   those is one shared blocker, not a set of buckets — see (c).
   (c) **[D4] The error-object model, and the buckets that sat behind it** (added 2026-09-04 from the (b)
   sweep; plan-notes 194).
   ~~**Check:** an `Error` object model in the runtime — constructor, `name`/`message`, the
   `instanceof` chain for the standard subclasses — proved by a golden that CATCHES a thrown builtin
   error and prints `name`, `message` and an `instanceof` result matching Node byte-for-byte~~
   ✅ **the model landed 2026-09-05** (plan-notes 195; evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5
   step 2a(c)) — five descriptors in `runtime/src/jsrt_error.c`, no new mechanism, STA4095 pinning
   the layout, and one WRONG ANSWER removed (`e instanceof Error` had compiled and answered false).
   **Still open under this step, now for three different reasons:**
   ~~2540 read-only assign~~ ✅ **landed 2026-09-05** in the same commit, which is the loop closing —
   (b) refused to suppress it precisely because the runtime could not build its answer, and now it
   compiles and the runtime raises Node's `TypeError`. ~~2704 read-only delete~~ ✅ **landed the same
   day but only as a RECLASSIFICATION** (plan-notes 196, measured): the `delete` operator has no
   lowering at all — no `DeleteExpression` case in `src/lower/` or `src/frontend/gate.ts`, no
   `jsrt_delete` — so dropping the checker's refusal moves the program from `STA0012` to
   `STA1214 (DeleteExpression)`. That is a legitimate §1.3 landing (checker lint → Stator's own
   schedule, naming the phase that owns the blocker) and **not** a claim that `delete` works; the
   operator is step-12 residue. · ~~**2790 `The operand of a 'delete' operator must be optional`**
   — a bucket the (b) sweep missed entirely, found by the same measurement (plan-notes 196): `delete`
   on a REQUIRED property, distinct from 2704's read-only one, a §1.2 violation whose JavaScript
   answer is a boolean, blocked on that same missing operator plus the shape question a fixed-shape
   object losing a field would ask.~~ ✅ **both delete buckets closed 2026-09-09** by landing the
   operator itself (plan-notes 210; evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5 step 2a(c)), which
   retires 2704's reclassification: `STA1214 (DeleteExpression)` is gone for every receiver the
   checker can type. · ~~**2304/2552 `Cannot find name` (1345 lines)**~~
   ✅ **landed 2026-09-05** (plan-notes 197; evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5 step 2a(c)).
   The gate needed no change after all — its global branch is guarded by `symbol !== undefined`, so a
   symbol-less identifier already fell through to `accept`, and it was the LOWERING that manufactured
   `STA4035`. Reading an undeclared name now throws a catchable `ReferenceError`, `typeof` answers
   `"undefined"` without throwing, and the three WRITE forms the suppression newly admitted were
   caught manufacturing `STA4034` and fixed in the same change — the TS2403 rule again, asked of 24
   syntactic positions instead of one fixture. · ~~**2488 `Symbol.iterator`**~~ ✅ **landed
   2026-09-16** (plan-notes 277; evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5 step 2a(c),
   unknown-iterable dispatch): js mode suppresses the checker's refusal and lowers `for-of`
   over any operand with no static walk through a `get-iterator` HIR node to the runtime
   GetIterator dispatch (`jsrt_get_iterator` — collections box, generators and stored
   iterators drive as-is, a user-iterable method resolves and runs, the rest throw Node's
   catchable `TypeError`), proved by `tests/golden/js/for_of_unknown.js` byte-for-byte and a
   both-modes decision pair (`subset_for_of_unknown_*`: `dynamic` in js, `error STA0012` in
   ts). ts mode keeps the refusal, and the gate there refuses only what the checker accepted
   (a custom `{ next() }` object, an `Iterable<T>` interface) so the STA0012 speaks alone; a
   `for-of` binding is not an annotation site, so the checker's recovery-`any` no longer
   buries it under STA1003.
   **2454 definite assignment** rejects an uninitialized annotated binding whose runtime value is
   `undefined`; it is **not TDZ**. True syntactic TDZ is 2448 (closure-mediated TDZ may have no
   checker diagnostic), and there is no runtime TDZ sentinel/check to convert. Suppressing 2454
   additionally requires sound dynamic method receivers rather than trusting the annotation
   (plan-notes 200, correcting note 195's premise).~~ ✅ **landed in wave 3** ([done.md](done.md)
   → Phase 5 wave 3: suppressed in js as a code plus binding widening; verified green in
   plan-notes 277 — `subset_definite_assignment_*`, both goldens). Both buckets are closed.
   · ~~**`missing.a = 1` and `missing[0] = 1` raise `STA4035`**~~ ✅ **fixed 2026-09-05**
   (plan-notes 199; [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5 step 2a(c), inferred JS namespaces).
   ~~**Check:** `typeof unresolvableName` answers `"undefined"` without throwing and a bare
   unresolvable reference throws a catchable `ReferenceError` whose `name`/`message`/`instanceof`
   match Node~~ ✅ 2026-09-05 (`tests/golden/js/reference_error.js`,
   `tests/golden/js/reference_error_write.js`). ~~**Check:** the panic-to-throw conversion lands with a
   golden that CATCHES each converted site~~ ✅ **2026-09-05** (plan-notes 200; evidence in
   [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5 step 2a(c), catchable property and iterator failures) — the nullish
   and primitive property sites and the iterator/generator receiver sites now throw Node's
   `TypeError`, caught by `tests/golden/js/property_errors.js` and
   `tests/golden/js/iterator_receiver_error.js`. The same conversion later reached the string-length
   builtins: `repeat`/`padStart`/`padEnd` throw a catchable `RangeError` matching Node instead of
   aborting (plan-notes 203; `tests/golden/{js,ts}/string_range_error`). The 2488/2454 buckets
   below were still open then, being not panics — both have since landed (2488: plan-notes 277;
   2454: wave 3). ~~**Check:** the two delete buckets (2704, 2790)
   land with the `delete` OPERATOR — lowering plus whatever
   answer a fixed-shape object gives when it loses a field — proved by a golden where `delete o.a`
   returns Node's boolean and the subsequent read answers `undefined`.~~ ✅ **2026-09-09**
   (plan-notes 210; evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5 step 2a(c), the `delete` operator) —
   `tests/golden/{ts,js}/delete_prop.*` match Node byte-for-byte. **The open half answered itself:**
   a fixed-shape object does not lose a field, it REFUSES — `STA1108` (never) in ts mode, `STA1205`
   (not-yet, Phase 8) in js, and `STA2007` at run time for an Unknown receiver that turns out fixed
   — the mirror of `STA2004`, lifted by the same dictionary-mode escape. In ts mode that refusal is
   nearly unreachable by construction: TS2790 demands an optional property and an optional property
   is exactly what makes a shape dynamic, so only a class field can reach `STA1108`.
   **Check:** each suppression lands with a both-modes decision fixture (the same source, `error` in
   ts and `dynamic` in js) and a golden proving js mode compiles it to Node's answer. The Test262
   ratchet moves in that commit **when a test's final classifier changes**; a harness file can carry
   several independent checker diagnostics, so removing an earlier one may only expose the next
   `STA0012` and leave the aggregate count honestly unchanged. In that case record the per-code
   before/after evidence in `plan-notes.md` rather than claim a numerical improvement that did not
   happen (plan-notes 182).
3. ~~Lower `var`: function-scoped binding, hoisting to the enclosing function (or module) scope,
   `undefined` init before the first statement runs, legal redeclaration folding to one slot.~~
   ✅ **landed** (2026-09-02, plan-notes 142).
4. ~~Dynamic lowering completion — Unknown property get/set, computed index, dynamic calls
   (`STA2006` at `file:line` for a non-function), and `==`/`!=` through `jsrt_loose_equals`.~~
   ✅ **landed** (2026-09-02, plan-notes 143) — STA4058 retired.
5. ~~Mixed-graph boundaries: a dynamic (Unknown) value reaching a checkable annotation is wrapped
   in `BoundaryCheck` at the EDGE — declaration, assignment, call argument, return.~~
   ✅ **landed** (2026-09-02, plan-notes 140, 144).
6. ~~JSDoc freebie test — a fully JSDoc'd `.js` module reports file verdict `static`,
   provenance `typed`.~~ ✅ **landed** (2026-09-02) — no compiler change was needed.
7. ~~Flip remaining js expected-fail + capstone golden.~~ ✅ **landed** (2026-09-02, plan-notes 146)
   — twelve fixtures flipped with honest verdicts; the rest wait on their owner steps, never
   bulk-flipped.
8. ~~The iterator protocol, and generators with it.~~ ✅ **landed** (2026-09-02, plan-notes 147–154)
   — `Symbol.iterator` as a stored value, `Symbol()` and `Symbol.for` stay `STA1212`; generator
   methods, async generators and `for await` stay `STA1201`; `yield*` and a custom `{next()}`
   object stay `STA1214`.
9. ~~Top-level await (`STA1208`).~~ ✅ **landed** (2026-09-02, plan-notes 155) — init order is
   Task 3.11's topological order, **not** Node's sibling-subgraph interleaving (a documented
   divergence, docs/MODES.md). `STA1208` is no longer emitted.
10. ~~Dynamic `import()` (`STA1207`).~~ ✅ **landed** (2026-09-02, plan-notes 156) — literal
    specifiers only; **computed specifier stays `STA1207`, owned by Phase 8 step 7**, and
    `import * as ns` stays `STA1214` (step 12).
11. ~~`Promise.prototype.then`/`catch`/`finally` and `new Promise(executor)` (`STA1216`).~~
    ✅ **landed** (2026-09-02, plan-notes 157) — combinator residue
    (`allSettled`/`any`/`race`/`withResolvers`/`try`) and a non-arity-1 constructor stay not-yet
    under `STA1216`.

12. **The lowering ladder's residue — `ts`-mode static language surface** (added 2026-09-01,
    plan-notes 136). Phase 3's rungs each landed a core and deferred its surface under
    `notYet(…, 3)` while Phase 3 was open; Phase 3 closed on 2026-08-30 having passed a Check about
    the eight rungs, not about what they deferred, and **70 gate sites outlived their owner** —
    still telling users, today, that rest parameters are "planned for Phase 3". This step owns
    them. It is not `js`-mode work and not the dynamic tier: every construct here is typed
    TypeScript with a statically known shape, which §1.1 promises will "eventually compile", in the
    product's DEFAULT mode. Land by family, each family flipping its `tests/subset/` rows out of
    expected-fail in the commit that lands it, never in bulk:
    ~~(a) **Parameter and binding forms** first, because every later family calls functions: rest,
    default, optional, uninitialized `let`, and shallow destructuring of parameters/declarations/
    catch.~~ ✅ **landed 2026-09-02** (plan-notes 158–161). **Residue:** nested patterns,
    rest-in-pattern, and default-in-pattern stay not-yet in this family.
    ~~(b) **Expression-position residue**: labels on anything but a loop or switch, capturing a
    variable declared inside a loop, `instanceof` against anything but a class name, assignment and
    compound assignment to a non-variable, `++`/`--` on a non-variable and in value position, and
    the binary/unary/statement catch-alls (`describeKind`).~~ ✅ **landed 2026-09-02**
    (plan-notes 164). **Residue:** accessor compound and `#n in o` stay not-yet (families (d) /
    private).
    (c) **[D3] Object literal forms**: shorthand, spread, method and accessor members; keys that are not
    identifiers. **Shorthand, non-identifier keys, and spread landed 2026-09-03** (plan-notes 181;
    evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5 step 12c, including the LAYOUT-vs-ENUMERATION order
    split it forced into `JSRTClass::key_order`).
    **Accessors landed 2026-09-04** (plan-notes 192; evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5
    step 12c accessors, including the two corrections to `docs/VALUE.md` §4.15 the implementation
    forced and the fixed-shape-position refusal it opened).
    **Methods landed 2026-09-12** (plan-notes 228; evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5 step 12c
    methods).
    **Computed keys landed 2026-09-12** (plan-notes 229; evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5
    step 12c computed keys).
    **A spread of an untyped value into a literal the checker types `any` landed** (plan-notes
    297: the operand folds through the shape-table `assign`, beside the array spread).
    **Residue:** a dropped `as` assertion's unknown operand, a value with no fixed shape in a
    fixed-typed literal (`{ ...null }`, an array beside an own key), and the methods-order
    shapes (`gate.ts` spread-prefix arms) stay `STA1214` — all need the dynamic tier (step 39),
    not this slice. Spread of any
    fixed-shape EXPRESSION compiles — variable, call, or member access, evaluated once via
    a scratch slot (`tests/golden/ts|js/spread_call_result.*`, `gate.test.ts` spread-call
    acceptance) — so the old "anything but a variable" line is retired here.
    (d) **[D5] The class member surface** — the largest family, and the reason rung 6 shipped as 6a/6b:
    static getters and setters, accessors with no body, computed and `#private` accessor names,
    index signatures, static initialization blocks, computed member names, a `#private` name an
    ancestor also declares, constructor and method overload signatures, a derived constructor that
    does not open with `super(...)`, more than one constructor, optional methods and fields, the
    override rules, anonymous classes, and the `extends` forms. The `this`/`super`/`new` position
    sites ride here (`this` in a static member or outside a class member; `super` on anything but
    an inherited method; `new` on anything but a named class).
    **Five slices landed 2026-09-16 on `agent/p5-class-surface`** (plan-notes 272–278; evidence
    in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5 step 12d): js override-widening for inferred method
    overrides (274), abstract classes/members via throw-stubs (275), static fields after static
    blocks in source order (276), branch `super` in init-free derived ctors with exactly-once
    refusal (273), and bound class expressions via descriptor erasure (278). **Residue:**
    abstract accessors (`gate.ts:3670` override arm — need virtual accessor dispatch),
    switch-guarded supers (the branch rule's `checkCtorList` covers `if`/`else`/blocks only —
    a `switch` stays `STA1214`), `super` in a static block (`gate.ts:3730`), `this` in a static
    member or block (`gate.ts:4711,4715`), bare `super` (`gate.ts:482,4984` — a JavaScript
    SyntaxError, stays refused), opaque class values (`gate.ts:904,919,940,5283` — need the
    class object), and anonymous defaults (`gate.ts:3584` — blocked on default imports).
    (e) **[D3] Values that need a closure or a class object**: ~~calling an arbitrary expression~~,
    ~~function declarations inside a block/loop/branch~~, ~~method values (`const f = o.m`)~~,
    ~~calling a class field~~, and ~~named function expressions~~ **landed** (evidence in
    [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5 step 12e); still open are an OPAQUE class use — anything but
    the in-place spellings (`new K`, `K.static`, `o instanceof K`, alias formation), which need
    the class object — and BARE `super` (the `super.m` tear-off landed as step 42; a `super`
    with no member is a JavaScript SyntaxError and stays refused).
    Method values use the method's own `JSRTClosure` with `has_receiver` so `jsrt_call` shifts when
    the receiver is omitted (`docs/VALUE.md` §4.16, plan-notes 208, 230); that is still not
    `Function.prototype.bind`'s two-slot `JSRTEnv` (which INSERTS a receiver where this DROPS one),
    which stays not-yet. A class used as a value and `super` as a value are blocked on the class
    object instead, which is family (d)'s. Named function expressions bind the function's own name
    inside its body only (plan-notes 231).
    (f) **[D4] Generics beyond monomorphization** last, because they multiply everything above.
    Constrained and defaulted type parameters specialize like any other call — the constraint
    is the checker's, the default fills what no call determines (`finishTuple`, `Unknown`
    when nothing does). Generic classes specialize per concrete tuple at each `new` site,
    inferred or explicit (evidence: done.md → Phase 5 waves 4–5). A generic function used as
    a value takes the canonical tuple, sharing its specialization with an undetermined call
    (step 41); explicit type arguments on a call or a `new` name the same specialization
    inference would; generic arrows and function expressions specialize under a module-scope
    `const` home. **An inline generic arrow or function expression passed directly as a call
    argument landed 2026-09-16** (plan-notes 279): it specializes at the parameter's function
    type under a position-derived key (`subset_generic_arrow_bare_*` now `static`, four new
    decision pairs, `tests/golden/ts|js/generic_inline.*` byte-for-byte).
    **Residue:** a homeless arrow anywhere else (`let`, a nesting, a branch, a spread, a
    constructor argument — no single parameter type to read), one (inline, named, or homed)
    whose body reads an enclosing scope or a same-file `let`/`const`/`var` (no binding a
    module-level specialization could read — plan-notes 280 refuses the named/homed shapes
    at the gate instead of failing downstream), a generic that escapes further (returned,
    stored — the dynamic tier), a generic call at a generic type (self-application — no
    monomorphic spelling), `instanceof` against a generic class (one descriptor per tuple),
    and the class-surface residue (a generic subclass of a generic base, raw or partial
    bounds — family (d)'s).
    **Check (step 12):** one golden fixture per family matching the pinned Node byte-for-byte; the
    decision-test rows for every construct named above out of expected-fail; and `gate.ts` emits no
    `not-yet` for any construct this step names.

13. ~~**Module-scope closures, and the two defects stacked in front of them**~~ ✅ **landed
    2026-09-04** (plan-notes 193) — evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5 step 13. A closure
    created at module scope capturing a loop-body binding read one shared global slot; the module
    now owns an environment for exactly those per-iteration bindings, so the loop's existing
    clone/commit runs there unchanged. Reproducing it first required fixing a console call in value
    position (returned `void` in C, so the generated file did not compile) and a `for-of` binding
    the lowering and the verifier typed from two different sources. Not step 12 residue: no
    `notYet` site ever named these — they are defects in shipped constructs.

14. ~~**[D3] Block scoping — a shadowed block binding shares the enclosing slot** (plan-notes 209).~~
    ✅ **landed 2026-09-11** (plan-notes 216; evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5 step 14).
    Alpha-renaming at the lowering: `src/lower/scope.ts` maps a source name to both its type and the
    HIR name a reference must use, and a declaration that would be a second home for its name in the
    slot space gets an unspellable one. The LEAK half — a name staying resolvable after its scope
    ended — landed separately and earlier the same day (plan-notes 215). **Check:** the four shapes
    (a `const`, a `let`, a parameter, a function declaration shadowed in nested blocks) match the
    pinned Node byte-for-byte in `tests/golden/js/block_shadow.js`; the
    `subset_block_function_shadow_*` rows are `static`; `gate.ts` emits no `not-yet` naming a
    shadowed block binding (the strings are gone). TDZ remains unmodelled and is NOT claimed.
15. ~~**[D4][P1] `await`/`yield` inside a per-iteration-env loop resumes into a C block**
    (plan-notes 223).~~ ✅ **landed 2026-09-11** (plan-notes 226; evidence in [done.md](done.md) →
    Phase 5 step 15). The loop's environment state lives in two frame SLOTS now — which `slotAt`
    resolves to the heap environment in an async or generator unit, where it survives a suspension —
    and `emitPark` writes `_jsrt_self->env = _jsrt_env;` before suspending, because the resume used
    to come back on the loop's base environment while the body read and wrote the iteration's clone.
    **Check:** `tests/golden/js/suspend_in_loop.js` — an async loop with a captured binding and an
    await in every iteration, nested loops, a `break` after an await, and a generator yielding from a
    captured loop — matches the pinned Node byte-for-byte at `-O2`, where the trap used to be.

16. ~~**An interface-typed value is a fixed layout whose HType is `unknown`**
    (plan-notes 223).~~ ✅ **landed 2026-09-11** (plan-notes 225; evidence in [done.md](done.md) →
    Phase 5 step 16). `isDynamicShape` accepts an interface (a class deliberately still does not —
    a class instance's declared layout is the point of ts mode), so an optional-property interface
    takes the shape table like its anonymous twin, and the five standard error interfaces map to
    `errorHType` in `tsTypeToHType` — with `isDynamicShape` excluding those five, whose optional
    `stack` would otherwise route `e.message` through the shape table. **Check:**
    `tests/golden/ts/interface_shape.ts` and `tests/golden/ts/error_family.ts` match the pinned Node
    byte-for-byte; the recorded choice (docs/SUBSET.md, plan-notes 225) is DYNAMIC for an interface
    with an optional property or an index signature.
17. ~~**A shadow-renamed function's display name leaks the HIR spelling into `console.log`**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-09-14** (plan-notes 247; evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5 step 17).
18. ~~**The `console` family takes exactly one argument**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-09-14** (`49d8193`; evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5 steps 18–38).
19. ~~**Variadic built-in argument forms name Phase 5**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-09-14** (`49d8193`; evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5 steps 18–38).
20. ~~**A dynamic receiver CRASHES where Node throws**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-09-14** (`49d8193`, new codes `STA2008`/`STA2009`; evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5 steps 18–38).
21. ~~**Four runtime-semantics divergences from the 2026-09-11 hunt**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-09-14** (`49d8193`; evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5 steps 18–38).
22. ~~**A computed object-literal key: methods are dropped and the read uses the wrong representation**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-09-14** (`49d8193`; evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5 steps 18–38).
23. ~~**A shadowed class declaration shares the outer class's identity**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-09-14** (`49d8193`; evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5 steps 18–38).
24. ~~**Optional chaining `?.` is silently ignored**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-09-14** (`49d8193`; evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5 steps 18–38).
25. ~~**`this` in an arrow inside a class field initializer is not captured**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-09-14** (`49d8193`; evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5 steps 18–38).
26. ~~**`js` mode rejects duplicate object literal keys**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-09-14** (`49d8193`; evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5 steps 18–38).
27. ~~**`ToNumber(string)` diverges from the spec in six measured ways**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-09-14** (`49d8193`; evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5 steps 18–38).
28. ~~**Fixed-shape objects ignore `OrdinaryOwnPropertyKeys`**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-09-14** (`6ed9f77`; evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5 steps 18–38).

## 9. Phase 6 — Conformance and differential fuzzing (starts after Phase 3; Test262 needs Phase 5; then forever) — **D2 · P2**

This phase produces no language features. It produces **evidence** — a conformance number, a
divergence hunt, and measurements — and its output is only as good as its honesty, so every step
below is written against one failure mode: a green signal that proves less than it appears to. A
skipped test counted as a pass, a fuzzer that generates programs the compiler already handles, a
benchmark of the wrong answer computed quickly. Each step names the dishonest version it exists to
prevent.

The tasks are independent and the phase's Check has one clause per task.

**All four tasks have landed** (6.1, 6.2, 6.2a, 6.3); their evidence is in [done.md](done.md) →
Phase 6, and the titles stay here so `§9 Task 6.N` references resolve. The phase is **not closed**:
its Check's fuzzing clause says *≥1 h nightly with zero unexplained divergences*, and what exists is
the scheduled job plus local runs — the clause passes on a nightly run's own output, cited here.
Task 6.3 also carries one named residue (its regression threshold's noise floor). Test262 tracking
is the standing output of 6.1 and does not close. Difficulty (§14 legend): the fuzzing clause is
**D1** (cite a nightly run's own output), the noise-floor residue **D2**.

~~**Task 6.1 — Test262 runner.**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-09-03** — evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 6.
First pinned number: **2379 passed, 10,513 failed, 40,688 skipped — 18.5%** over `passed + failed`,
ratcheted in `tests/test262/ratchet.json`. Three rules from it survive here because they are rules,
not history:

- A build that raised **nothing but** `STA12xx` is a **skip attributed to that code**, never a
  failure. §1.3 keeps the never and not-yet ranges disjoint so a test can tell intent from schedule;
  step 4 already said this for negative tests, and it is no less true for positive ones. A build
  that raised anything else stays a failure, so the skip bucket cannot swallow a real refusal.
- The **ratchet is the gate**, not `expected-fail.txt`. At 53,580 tests a per-test expectation file
  becomes an artifact nobody reads, and an unreadable list explains nothing. Unexplained failures
  are printed as a bounded sample plus a total; `passed` may not drop and `failed` may not rise.
- **Everything in the skip column must name a rule about the compiler.** A skip looks deliberate,
  which is exactly why a runner's own defects go there to hide: the first pass skipped 17,003 tests
  on `flags: [generated]` (a provenance note with no execution meaning) and reported 294
  `_FIXTURE.js` files — which INTERPRETING.md says are not tests — as tests with unreadable headers
  (plan-notes 176).

~~**Task 6.2 — Differential fuzzing.**~~ ✅ **built 2026-09-02, hardened 2026-09-03** — evidence in
[done.md](done.md) → Phase 6. `packages/tests/differential/` generates type-directed programs from
one seeded xorshift, weights the grammar at the regions the golden suite cannot enumerate, runs them
against the pinned Node byte-for-byte, minimizes divergences, and runs an hour nightly per
`.github/workflows/nightly.yml`. Three rules survive here because they are standing practice, not
history:

- **A generated program that fails to compile is a GENERATOR bug** and the generator gets fixed —
  unless the diagnostic is `STA4xxx` (internal error), which is a real finding: an exception
  reaching the CLI is always a compiler bug (`AGENTS.md`'s diagnostics conventions).
- **Never normalize output to make a comparison pass.** stdout is compared byte-for-byte against
  the pinned Node from `.node-version` and only that Node, and a timeout counts as a divergence
  (an infinite loop in emitted code is a bug, not a slow test) — the golden-test rule applies here
  identically.
- **Every divergence becomes a golden test in the commit that fixes it**, with the raw
  pre-minimization program in `tests/differential/corpus/`. Fixing the bug without landing the
  fixture is how the same divergence returns.

~~**Task 6.2a — Pin the ground truth's invocation.**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-09-08** — evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 6.

~~**Task 6.3 — Benchmark harness.**~~ ✅ **built 2026-09-02, hardened 2026-09-03** — evidence in
[done.md](done.md) → Phase 6. Five compute programs (fib, nbody, JSON round-trip, string churn, and
the empty startup floor) verified against Node at record time so a wrong answer computed quickly
aborts the recording; engines discovered on `PATH` with an absent one written as `"absent"`; RSS
normalized to bytes with the raw value beside it; results appended per host; and
`tests/bench/README.md` **generated** by the weekly cron in `nightly.yml`. Two rules survive here:

- **Never quote a competitor's self-published figure as a measurement.** A number this harness did
  not produce on this machine is not a measurement and does not go in the file.
- **CI does not commit to `main`** — the owner's answer, 2026-09-04 (plan-notes 190). No
  write-scoped token, no bot commits on the default branch; the generated page is regenerated and
  committed by whoever runs `bench:record`, which is where the machine-local rule already puts the
  authority. Reopening this is a plan edit.

**[D2] Open residue — step 7's noise floor.** The regression gate compares the geomean against the newest
previous result for the same host and fails above `thresholdPercent: 20`. The step requires that
threshold to sit above a **measured** spread; what has been measured is one repeat on one host
(22.358 → 21.458 ms, **4.0%**, same commit — done.md) plus five repeats on a second host
(21.215–22.778 ms, **7.4%** max spread — plan-notes 246), and the 20% gate stands on both with
~3× headroom. Still open, narrowed: the Check names the machine that runs the weekly job, and
neither host is it. **Check:** a handful of repeats of one commit
on the machine that runs the weekly job, the observed spread recorded in `plan-notes.md`, and the
gate set from it. A gate below the noise floor fires on noise, and an alarm that fires on noise is
one people learn to ignore — which costs more than having no gate at all.

~~**Task 6.4 — Plain `test` is the gate; `test:coverage` is on-demand only.**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-09-14** — evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 6 Task 6.4.

~~**Task 6.5 — Pin the oracle: the ground truth is named, never inherited from the host.**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-09-14** — evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 6 Task 6.5.

~~**Task 6.6 — In-process subset and golden runners.**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-09-14** — evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 6 Task 6.6 (including the lowering-leak fix, plan-notes 242).

~~**Task 6.7 — `cli.test.ts` spawns in parallel.**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-09-14** — evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 6 Task 6.7 (plan-notes 242).

~~**Task 6.8 — Stop paying for the duplicate ASan golden pass (or prove it free).**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-09-14 as option (a)** — evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 6 Task 6.8 (plan-notes 252).

~~**Task 6.9 — Key the program cache on content, not mtime.**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-09-14** — evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 6 Task 6.9 (plan-notes 245).

~~**Task 6.10 — The differential oracle must never record a divergence it cannot reproduce.**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-09-14** — evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 6 Task 6.10 (plan-notes 253).

~~**Task 6.11 — The duplication gate is red, and blind to the differential harness.**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-09-14** — evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 6 Task 6.11 (plan-notes 255).

~~**Task 6.12 — Pin the oracle exactly; the preflight compares majors only.**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-09-15** — evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 6 Task 6.12 (plan-notes 268).

~~**Task 6.13 — The golden runner reports its skipped `intl_*` fixtures.**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-09-14** — evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 6 Task 6.13 (plan-notes 253).

~~**Task 6.14 — A checker stack overflow must fail its test, never its shard.**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-09-14** — evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 6 Task 6.14 (plan-notes 254).

**Task 6.15 — No JavaScript in our own source (§0.10, plan-notes 289).** Port to strict TS (Node
runs them through type stripping, as it runs every harness today): the oracle shims
(`packages/tests/golden/*/*/node_shim.mjs`, `examples/ffi/*/node_shim.mjs`), the runtime print
corpus (`packages/runtime/tests/print_*.mjs`), `scripts/check-node.mjs`,
`packages/runtime/vendor/update.mjs`, `packages/runtime/vendor/fdlibm/port.mjs` and
`site/astro.config.mjs`. Exempt: `js`-mode test inputs and examples, vendored upstream code,
generated output, `site/public/` assets. **Check:** `git ls-files '*.js' '*.mjs' '*.cjs'` lists only
exempt paths; a lint step (a few lines in `scripts/`) enforces that list in `ci`; `pnpm run ci`
green.

**Task 6.16 — Work the clone baseline to zero (AGENTS.md golden rule 10).** `.jscpd-baseline.json`
records 224 clones (identifier-insensitive, tests/vendor/docs excluded — 4.6% of our source, of
which 1.1% exact) as debt. Extract a shared helper per clone family at the responsible layer
(`lower/`, `codegen/`, `runtime/src/jsrt_array_ops.c` lead the list) and shrink the baseline with
`pnpm run dupes:baseline` in the same change. **Check:** the baseline is empty; `pnpm run dupes`
then runs with no baseline at all.

~~**Task 6.17 — Test impact: build and run only what a change reaches.**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-10-02**
(steps 1–3 and 5; Check (a)–(e) passed) — evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 6 Task 6.17
(plan-notes 293). **Still open — step 4, CI:** after PR #45's staged pipeline, `main` and the
nightly run `pnpm run test:impact:record` and upload `.cache/impact/impact-map.json` as an
artifact; pull requests download the newest `main` map and run `pnpm run test:impact` (it falls
back to the full run, saying why, when that map is missing or not an ancestor). Done when a pull
request's CI log shows a selection made from a `main` map.

~~**Task 6.18 — `stator.config.json`: every CLI option in one validated file.**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-10-02** — evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 6 Task 6.18 (plan-notes 303; `docs/CONFIG.md`).

~~**Task 6.19 — Stator compiles itself and its own packages: a self-compilation test.**~~ ✅
**landed 2026-10-02**: evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 6 Task 6.19 (plan-notes 306).
`pnpm run test:selfhost` is in `ci`. Three parts stay here, because they are still rules or not
built yet:

- **Targets.** Every directory under `packages/` is a target in
  `packages/tests/selfhost/targets.json`, or it is in that file's `notTargets` with a reason.
  `packages/node` (T11.6), `packages/webapi` (T13.1), `packages/renderer-clay` (T13.4) and
  `packages/interpreter` (T14.1) are added there by the card that creates them, in the same change.
  Each one gets a `stator.config.json` for its mode and entry.
- **Ratchet.** `packages/tests/selfhost/baseline.json` holds each target's verdict and its count per
  diagnostic code. The test fails when a count grows, a new code appears or a verdict gets worse.
  It also fails when a count shrinks, until `--update` records the shrink in the same change.
  **Growth may be recorded** (creator, 2026-10-02, plan-notes 306): a change that grows a count
  runs `--update` in the same change, so the increase shows in `baseline.json`'s diff for review.
  This differs from `dupes:baseline`, which only ever shrinks.
  Whether growth may be recorded is open for the creator (plan-notes 306). When a target reaches
  zero, that is its milestone, and from then on its build and smoke check are part of the gate.
- **Stage-2 check (not built).** When the compiler's verdict becomes `static` or `dynamic`, its
  binary compiles a hello-world fixture. That C output must be **byte-identical** to the C the
  Node-hosted compiler emits. Until this check exists, the runner fails when a `stage2` target
  reaches either verdict.

**Standing decision — Bun is not a test runner (2026-09-14, plan-notes 241).** Measured on this host (Bun 1.3.14 vs pinned Node 26.x): subset −5%, spawn-heavy unit −37%, in-process parity — while adopting it silently redefines the oracle (`process.execPath`), breaks the lcov pipeline (Node-only flags), and weakens the `erasableSyntaxOnly` runtime guard (Bun transpiles what Node type-stripping refuses). Reopen only with new measured evidence per §15.4. Task 6.5 is the prerequisite that keeps the question askable.

**Check:** Test262 % visible and monotonically tracked; fuzzer runs ≥1 h nightly with zero unexplained divergences; benchmark page auto-updates; a shell whose bare `node` is off-pin cannot run CI silently (Task 6.2a); the unit gate runs without coverage (Task 6.4); the oracle never resolves to the host (Task 6.5).

## 10. Phase 7 — FFI (est. +4–6 weeks)

Research verdict: only Static Hermes has bidirectional, header-driven FFI — and even there the binding generator is an experimental in-tree script. A differentiator worth building properly; emitting C makes it natural.

"Emitting C makes it natural" is true of the CALL and false of everything around it. The call itself
is a line of C. The phase is four weeks because of what surrounds it, and all four surprises are the
same shape — a thing that is implicit inside the compiled world and must become explicit at the
edge:

- **Memory.** Inside, Boehm sees every pointer because generated code keeps them in `JSRT_FRAME`
  slots. A pointer handed to C is invisible to the collector for the duration of the call, and the
  callee may keep it after returning. Every FFI signature therefore has to say who owns what and
  for how long — the compiler cannot infer it, and getting it wrong is a use-after-free, not a
  diagnostic.
- **Strings.** The runtime's strings are UTF-16 (a settled decision, §15.4); C wants bytes. There is
  no free conversion, so there is no implicit one.
- **Errors.** C reports failure by return value, `errno`, or an out-param, and it never unwinds.
  A JS exception must never propagate into a C frame, and a C error code only becomes an exception
  if the declaration says how.
- **Direction asymmetry.** 7.1 (calling out) is a compile-time question. 7.2 (being called in) is a
  runtime-lifecycle question: initialization, stack roots, threads, and what a C caller sees when
  TS throws. They share the ABI table and nothing else.

Order is 7.1 → 7.2 → 7.3 and it is not arbitrary: 7.2 reuses 7.1's type mapping in reverse, and 7.3
generates the declarations 7.1 consumes — a generator built before the shape of a hand-written
binding is known would be generating guesses.

**Out of scope for v0, stated here so it is a decision rather than an omission** (each may return as
its own task, with a `plan-notes.md` entry and a `SUBSET.md` row):

| Not in v0 | Why |

| Struct **by value** across the boundary | ABI-specific layout/alignment per platform and per struct; by-pointer covers the real use cases |
| Varargs (`printf`) | No sound signature; each call site is a different function type |
| C++ symbols, name mangling, exceptions | A second ABI, not an extension of this one |
| C **calling back into** a JS closure | Needs a trampoline plus a GC root for the closure that outlives the call. Task 7.2's exported functions are the supported way for C to call in |
| Threads | v0 FFI stays single-threaded (Task 7.2 step 6); **OS threads + async bridge are Phase 10** (T10.2), which reopens this |

**[D4] Task 7.1 — Calling C from TS.** `declare` + a marker (mirroring `$SHBuiltin.extern_c`) lowers to a direct call — no boxing for primitives; ownership rules for pointers/strings documented per-signature.

Steps (detailed 2026-09-01; plan-notes 131):
1. **Decide the surface before writing lowering, and write it down first.** Nothing under
   `src/frontend/` handles ambient `declare function` today, so this is new gate surface rather
   than a tweak to an existing path. Pick the marker — a `declare function` in a `.d.ts` plus an
   explicit per-declaration marker, TS-native, rather than Static Hermes's `$SHBuiltin.extern_c`
   call form — and land it in `docs/SUBSET.md` + a new `docs/FFI.md` **before** any code. Per
   §15.6, inventing this convention in code instead of in the docs is the failure mode. Three
   sub-decisions the doc has to settle, because each becomes unchangeable once bindings exist:
   where the marker attaches (declaration, or a whole `.d.ts` file), how the C symbol name is
   spelled when it differs from the TS name, and whether an extern declaration is legal outside a
   `.d.ts` (recommend no — keeping it in declaration files is what makes 7.3's generator's output a
   drop-in).

   Steps 1–2 ✅ landed 2026-09-14 in `a732cd5`: `docs/FFI.md` (marker, ABI table, lifetimes, errors,
   boundary rules), `docs/SUBSET.md` FFI rows, `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md` codes STA1114–STA1121 (never)
   + STA1217 (not-yet Phase 7). Steps 3–5 ✅ landed 2026-09-14 (runtime converters + corpus,
   gate refusals, extern-call lowering with error mapping; evidence in [done.md](done.md) →
   Phase 7 steps 4–5). Steps 6–9 landed: borrow-only opaque-pointer pass-through (§6), `@statorLink`/`--link=` plumbing (§9), the `explain` unchecked-boundary mark (§5), and `js`-mode boundary checks at extern calls (evidence: [done.md](done.md) → Phase 7, plan-notes 266). Step 10 landed 2026-09-15: libm goldens in both modes, the self-compiled `.c` fixture through the `--link=` channel, the ASan buffer-ownership check, and a real `--emit-header` double build — all as passing checks in `packages/tests/ffi/run.ts` (plan-notes 266).
2. **The ABI table is the contract, and it is small on purpose.** It lives in `docs/FFI.md`
   (§2 — this table below is the original sketch; the doc is authoritative where they differ):

   | TS type | C type | Notes |
   |---|---|---|
   | `number` | `double` | The unmarked case; no conversion |
   | `number` + `i32` refinement | `int32_t` | The refinement already exists (`docs/NUMERIC.md`) |
   | `boolean` | `bool` | `<stdbool.h>` |
   | `void` | `void` | Return position only |
   | branded pointer type | `T*` | Opaque; never dereferenced by generated code |
   | explicit `CString`-style wrapper | `const char*` | Allocates; see step 3 |
   | anything else | — | Compile error |

   **`string` deliberately maps to nothing.** UTF-16 in, bytes out means a real conversion with a
   real allocation, so it is spelled at the declaration and never inferred. `Unknown`, objects,
   arrays, and closures are errors here by construction — they are the cases that would need
   boxing, and "no boxing for primitives" is only meaningful if the non-primitives are refused
   rather than silently boxed. Each refusal gets its own code, allocated in `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md`
   (the sole allocator — never here).
3. **String conversion, both directions, with the lifetime written down.** In: allocate a NUL-
   terminated UTF-8 copy for the call and free it after (the callee gets a borrow; if it stores the
   pointer, the declaration must say so and the copy must be transferred instead). Out: a
   `const char*` return is copied into a runtime string at the boundary — never wrapped, because a
   wrapper's lifetime belongs to the C library and nothing in the runtime can track it. Embedded
   NULs and invalid UTF-8 need a stated answer, not an accident.
4. **Errors: C returns codes, and only the declaration knows what they mean.** Fix the policy here
   or every binding invents its own. Default: the return value is a plain value and a failing call
   is not an exception. Opt in per declaration to one of a closed set of conventions — nonzero is
   an error, negative is an error, NULL is an error, `errno` carries it — and the lowering emits
   the throw. Two absolutes: a JS exception must **never** unwind through a C frame (the call is
   made outside any construct that could throw across it), and an unmapped nonzero return must not
   be silently discarded.
5. **Lowering and the emitter.** An extern-marked call becomes a direct C call: typed values are
   already unboxed, so the work is making sure the emitter does not route them through `jsrt_value`
   on the way out, that the `#include` reaches the emitted translation unit, and that argument
   evaluation order and any temporaries (step 3's string copies) are freed on **every** exit path,
   landing pads included — the same discipline `JSRT_FRAME` already demands of generated code.
6. **GC and ownership, per signature, in the declaration.** A pointer handed to C is invisible to
   Boehm for the duration of the call; the frame that owns it must stay live across the call, and
   the callee must not retain it past return unless the declaration says it takes ownership. Two
   options only — **borrowed for the call** or **copied/transferred** — because a third would be a
   lifetime the compiler cannot express. This is documentation the compiler cannot check, which is
   exactly why it is per-signature rather than one global paragraph. A binding that keeps a pointer
   (SQLite's statement handles) uses the branded-pointer type, whose lifetime is the C library's,
   not the collector's.
7. **Link plumbing.** An extern declaration needs a header to include and a library to link.
   `linkExecutable` in `src/cli/build.ts` already assembles the clang link line (and already
   handles conditional `-lgc`), so extern-declared libraries append there; flags come from the
   declaration file plus a `--link=` CLI escape hatch. Duplicate libraries are deduplicated while
   preserving order — link order is load-bearing for static archives, and a "helpful" sort here
   breaks builds in a way that looks like a missing symbol.
8. **Name the trust boundary honestly.** §0 rule 2 says never trust an annotation without a
   boundary — but a C return value **cannot** be runtime-checked, so FFI is the one boundary where
   the annotation is asserted by a human and not verified. Do not paper over that: `stator explain`
   marks extern calls as an **unchecked boundary** so an audit can enumerate every one of them, and
   `docs/FFI.md` states the asymmetry in the same words. This is also the honest answer to "why is
   FFI not available in `ts` mode's safety story" — it is, with the caveat printed.
9. **`js` mode.** Arguments arriving from untyped code are dynamic, so they get a boundary check at
   the call and `STA2001` on mismatch — the existing runtime trap doing its existing job, not a new
   mechanism. The extern declaration itself is identical in both modes; only the checks differ.
10. **Tests.** Decision tests in both modes (extern call, refused non-primitive, refused varargs).
   The golden test links **libm** — `sqrt`, `fmod` — and a two-function `.c` fixture the harness
   compiles itself, so the golden suite depends on nothing installed; SQLite belongs to Task 7.3
   and the phase Check. At least one ASan test where C writes into a buffer the runtime owns, since
   that is the failure this design is most likely to produce and the ASan job already exists.

**[D4] Task 7.2 — Exposing TS to C.** `--emit-header` generates a `.h` for exported functions (Static Hermes `--exported-unit` model); values crossing out are C ABI types where sound, `jsrt_value` otherwise.

Steps 1–2 ✅ landed 2026-09-15 (`4445956`; evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 7 Task 7.2 steps 1–2). Steps 3–8 landed: init contract, throws companion + sentinel, frame/stack roots, the single-thread sentence, mangling + `--unit-name` + version symbol, and header determinism including a real double build in `packages/tests/ffi/run.ts` (evidence: [done.md](done.md) → Phase 7, docs/FFI.md §8, plan-notes 266). Step 9 landed 2026-09-15: the C-consumer example (`packages/tests/ffi/example-c-consumer/`, success + `last_error` paths, header `cmp`) wired into the ffi CI job (plan-notes 266).

Steps (detailed 2026-09-01; plan-notes 131):
1. **`--emit-header` in the CLI**, reusing Task 7.1's ABI table in the other direction: an exported
   function whose WHOLE signature is in the table gets a plain C prototype; anything else takes and
   returns `jsrt_value`. One table, two directions — a second, subtly different mapping is how the
   two halves drift apart. The flag also implies a build-mode change: the output is a linkable
   object/archive rather than an executable, since a unit exposed to C usually has no `main`.
2. **Decide what is exportable, and refuse the rest with a diagnostic.** Exported `function`
   declarations with in-table signatures are the core. Exported `const` of a primitive type can be
   a `#define`-free `extern const`. Classes, closures, generics, and mutable module state are NOT
   exported in v0 — a generic has no single C signature, and a closure has captured state with a
   lifetime C cannot hold. Refusing them loudly is the difference between a small feature and a
   half-working one.
3. **The init contract is the load-bearing part.** A C `main()` must initialize the runtime — GC,
   interned strings, and every module's top-level side effects **in dependency order** — before
   calling anything. Emit `stator_init_<unit>(void)`, declare it first in the header, make it
   idempotent (a second call is a no-op, because a library's init being called by two independent
   consumers is normal), and state in the header's own comment that calling an exported function
   first is undefined behavior. Getting this wrong is silent, not loud — which is why it is a
   generated declaration rather than a line in a doc.
4. **What C sees when TS throws.** Exceptions cannot cross the C ABI, so decide once and generate
   the same thing everywhere: an exported function's generated stub catches everything at the
   boundary. In-table signatures have no room in the return value for an error, so the escape is a
   companion `stator_last_error(void)` (NULL when the last call succeeded) plus a documented
   sentinel return, and the header says the call must be checked. The alternative — abort the
   process on an uncaught exception — is defensible for v0 but must be a written choice, not the
   default that happens if nobody decides. Whatever is chosen, an exception must never unwind into
   the C caller's frame.
5. **Frame and stack roots.** A function entered from C has no parent `JSRT_FRAME`, and Boehm needs
   that thread's stack base to scan conservatively; the generated entry stub establishes both, and
   pops the frame on every exit path including the one step 4 introduces.
6. **Threads: single-threaded in v0, said out loud.** Calling in from a second thread is undefined
   until a task says otherwise, and the generated header carries that sentence. Discovering it
   from a crash is the expensive way to learn it.
7. **Name mangling and ABI identity.** Exported `foo` from unit `m` becomes `stator_m_foo`;
   `--unit-name` sets the prefix (the `--exported-unit` model). A collision is a compile error,
   never a silent last-writer-wins. Emit a version symbol the header asserts against, so a header
   from one build linked against an archive from another fails at link time instead of at runtime.
8. **The header must be deterministic.** Same input, byte-identical output — no timestamps, no
   absolute paths, no hash-ordered iteration. A generated file that changes on every build cannot be
   committed, diffed, or reviewed, and this one is the artifact users will commit.
9. **CI example.** A small `main.c` + the emitted header, compiled and run inside the existing
   `runtime` job (which already has clang and the archive), asserting both a successful call and
   the step-4 error path. An FFI story that is not built in CI decays within a month.

**[D5] Task 7.3 — Bindings for existing headers.** ✅ **landed 2026-09-15** — evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 7 Task 7.3 (plan-notes 271). Start **manual** (hand-written `declare` files for the demo libs). A libclang-driven generator (functions + scalars + structs-by-pointer only) is built only after ≥3 manual bindings exist to define its spec.

Steps (detailed 2026-09-01; plan-notes 131):
1. **Three manual bindings, chosen for three different shapes** — that is what makes them a spec
   rather than three examples of the same case:
   - **libm** — scalars only, no allocation, no lifetime. Proves the plain path and needs nothing
     installed (it is also Task 7.1's golden test).
   - **SQLite** — opaque handles (`sqlite3*`, `sqlite3_stmt*`), out-params, strings in both
     directions, and error codes. It exercises every hard rule at once, which is why the phase
     Check uses it.
   - **A struct-by-pointer library** — POSIX `stat`, or zlib. Proves the one aggregate shape v0
     supports, including field offsets the binding must not guess.
   Each lands in `examples/ffi/` as a `.d.ts` with its link pragma plus a runnable example.
2. **Record every ambiguity as it is hit**, in `plan-notes.md`, while writing the bindings — those
   notes ARE the generator's requirements document, they are what "define its spec" means in the
   task line, and they are unrecoverable afterwards. Expect them to cluster on: which pointers the
   library retains, which returned strings the caller must free, and which error codes mean
   "failure" versus "no more rows".
3. **Then choose the generator's front end, cheapest rung first.** libclang via napi bindings is a
   new native dependency, and the dependency budget is `typescript` only. `clang -Xclang
   -ast-dump=json` needs **no** new dependency, and clang is already a hard requirement of every
   build. Start there; overturning it needs measured evidence that the JSON AST cannot express
   something the bindings need — recorded in `plan-notes.md` (§15.3), not a preference.
4. **The generator's shape:** parse the header's declarations into a small IR, map each C type
   through Task 7.1's ABI table **in reverse**, and print a `.d.ts`. Everything the table cannot
   map is refused, not approximated. Typedef chains resolve to their underlying type; an anonymous
   struct behind a typedef is still a branded pointer. Output must be deterministic and stable
   across runs (same rule as 7.2 step 8) — a generated binding is a file people commit.
5. **Scope limits are enforced, not documented.** Functions, scalars, and structs-by-pointer only.
   Varargs, function pointers, unions, bitfields, macro constants, and inline functions are
   **rejected with a diagnostic naming the construct and its header line** — a generator that
   silently skips what it cannot express produces a binding that looks complete and is not, which
   is the single worst failure mode available to this task. A summary line reports how many
   declarations were emitted and how many refused, per reason.
6. **The manual bindings become the generator's oracle.** Regenerate SQLite's binding and diff it
   against the hand-written one; every difference is either a generator bug or a manual-binding bug,
   and each one gets resolved rather than tolerated. This is the only cheap test that the generator
   understands real headers, and it costs nothing because both files already exist.
7. **The phase Check's SQLite demo is assembled from GENERATED bindings** once the generator exists;
   the manual binding stays in the tree as step 6's oracle. The demo also exercises Task 7.2 (the
   same example is called from a C `main()`), which is what makes the Check one example instead of
   two.

**Check:** ✅ **met 2026-09-15** — `examples/ffi/sqlite/` (generated binding + demo + C `main()`), proven locally byte-for-byte with the pinned Node; the CI proof is the ffi job's own run (plan-notes 271): an example that statically links SQLite, queries it from TS, and is itself callable from a C `main()` — built and run in CI.

## 11. Phase 8 — The dynamic tier (gated; `js` mode only) — **[D5]**

Gate: real users blocked on untyped npm dependencies or `eval`. Do not build speculatively.

**See also Phase 14 (§11f):** an interpreter in strict TypeScript is the creator-directed first
fallback for `eval` and `new Function`. T14.0 §7 decides whether this phase is still needed
after it.

- Embed **QuickJS-NG** in the runtime (scriptc `--dynamic` / Perry-eval model): `eval`, `new Function`, `Proxy`, and stubborn untyped modules run interpreted; a marshaling layer converts `jsrt_value` ↔ `JSValue` at the boundary (objects proxied by handle, not deep-copied).
- justfile feature flag so pure-static builds are unchanged. **`ts` mode is untouched: `eval` stays `STA1101`, permanently.**

Steps (detailed 2026-09-01; plan-notes 131). Steps 1 and 2 are not implementation — they are the
two things that must exist before implementation is allowed to start:
1. **Close the gate with evidence, the way Phase 0 was closed.** The gate is "real users blocked on
   untyped npm dependencies or `eval`", and the entry criterion is a written record of WHICH users
   and WHICH dependency or `eval` site — named, not estimated. Owner approval is recorded like
   Phase 0's (plan-notes 123). Until that record exists, this phase does not start; "do not build
   speculatively" is the whole gate, and a phase this large is exactly what a speculative build
   costs.
2. **Design doc before code: the marshaling layer, in `docs/` and reviewed.** It is the entire risk
   of the phase, and it has to answer three things. (a) **Handles both ways, never deep copies** — a
   `jsrt_value` object reaching interpreted code becomes a `JSValue` holding an opaque handle, and
   the reverse; a copy would make mutation invisible across the boundary. (b) **Identity must round-
   trip**: an object that crosses out and back must be `===` to itself, which means a two-way handle
   table, not a per-crossing wrapper. (c) **Two collectors** — Boehm (conservative, ours) and
   QuickJS's refcount-plus-cycle collector — so a live handle must be a root on both sides
   simultaneously. State plainly which cases leak: a cycle spanning the boundary is uncollectable
   in v0, and that ceiling belongs in the doc rather than being discovered later.
3. **Vendor the interpreter at the version already in the tree.**
   `runtime/vendor/quickjs-ng/VENDOR.md` pins `v0.16.2` (`1ab8676…`, vendored 2026-08-30) for
   `libregexp`/`libunicode`. The interpreter ships its own copies of those files, so a second
   version — or a naive add of the full source next to the existing subset — is duplicate symbols
   at link time, not a merge conflict a compiler will catch. Vendor `quickjs.c`/`quickjs.h` at the
   **same commit**, extend the existing `VENDOR.md` rather than starting a second one, and check who
   supplies the `lre_*` embedder callbacks once both halves are present. Acquisition is
   `node runtime/vendor/update.mjs quickjs-ng` (`pnpm run vendor:update`) with `quickjs.c`/
   `quickjs.h` added to that manifest — the same route the existing drop took, and it reaches the
   network (plan-notes 188 corrects the stale no-network constraint). The commit, not the transport,
   is the constraint.
4. **Feature flag on the Task 4.4 model, which already works.** `just runtime-dynamic` builds a
   separate archive into its own build directory, exactly as `just runtime-intl` does, and gets its own CI
   job like `intl` has. The default archive must not gain a byte — which is what the flag is FOR,
   and step 8 is how that claim is checked instead of asserted.
5. **`eval` and `new Function` in `js` mode:** `STA1206` is now emitted as not-yet (Phase 5 step 2);
   the interpreter that retires it lands here. Compile the string at runtime through the interpreter,
   marshal the result back, and give the interpreted scope access to the compiled module's bindings
   through the handle table (the scope bridge, not just the value bridge — a decision the step-2 doc
   has to settle, since a design where `eval` cannot see the enclosing scope is a different feature
   with the same name).
6. **`Proxy` and the descriptor/prototype surface** (`STA1204`): `Object.create`, `defineProperty`,
   `getPrototypeOf`/`setPrototypeOf` were assigned here by §7's exit criterion. They land as
   interpreted-tier objects — the shape model deliberately cannot express them, which is why they
   waited for this phase and not for more shape work.
7. **The computed-specifier half of dynamic `import()`** (Phase 5 step 10c): runtime module
   resolution needs a runtime module system, which is what this tier is. **Owner-confirmed
   2026-09-04** (plan-notes 190) — the conditional this step used to carry pointed at a
   confirmation that had never been recorded, so `STA1207`'s residue read as an open question for
   two days while step 10 was already closed against it. It is settled: the computed specifier is
   Phase 8's.
8. **`ts` mode is untouched, and that is a test, not a promise.** A decision test asserts `eval` in
   `ts` mode is still `STA1101` **with the dynamic tier built in**. For the Check's byte-identical
   clause: record the default archive's size and content hash before and after the phase, and have
   CI compare them — a size that is "the same as far as anyone looked" is not the claim being made.
9. **Every code flip is a decision-test change in the same commit** (`// @verdict: not-yet` →
   `dynamic`, with the `// @expected-fail: true` marker removed in that same commit — the standing
   rule in `AGENTS.md`). A `not-yet` code that stops being emitted while its fixture still expects
   it is drift, and the subset runner is what catches it.

**Check:** a `js`-mode program mixing one compiled module + one `eval` call runs correctly; binaries built without the feature (and all `ts`-mode binaries) are byte-identical in size to before.

---

## 11a. Phase 9 — Zig memory core — **[D5 · P1]**

Creator's direction (plan-notes 238): rewrite the **memory core** of the C runtime in Zig. This
phase is **not sequenced after Phase 8** — §11 is gated on a named user and may never start;
T9.1 proceeds independently. §15.1's top-down rule does not apply here.

The Zig modules export the same C ABI and link into `libjsrt.a`. `jsrt_value.h` stays the
codegen↔runtime contract, and generated code stays C. Boehm GC stays: Zig calls bdw-gc through
its C ABI. Zig 0.16.0 is pinned in stator's `mise.toml`; a global 0.14.1 (if present) is
untouched. This reopens the settled C11-runtime decision (§15.4) on the creator's direction.

### ~~T9.1. Runtime memory core in Zig~~ ✅ — landed; record in `done.md` (§11a).

### Language & library boundaries

Normative. Agents do not invent a second compiler language, a Rust crate, or a new runtime.
Full survey: plan-notes 239. Short form:

| Layer | Choice | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Compiler | TypeScript + `typescript` API in-process | settled |
| Emit / link | C; clang + `libjsrt.a` | settled |
| Generated code | C only | settled |
| Rust | nowhere, including MMTk | settled (§15.4) |
| Runtime | C11 + Zig: the memory core (T9.1) and all new memory-managing or cross-platform code (§0.5) | creator direction (238, 289) |
| `std` + OS threads | First-party `jsrt_std_*` + `std/*` modules; threads↔async bridge | Phase 10 (240) |
| Host compile parallelism | Same TS compiler; `STATOR_COMPILE_JOBS` / worker or process pool | Phase 10 T10.3 (240) |
| Vendored | QuickJS-NG libregexp/libunicode, fdlibm | settled |
| Optional native | Boehm; ICU (intl build) | settled |
| CLI-only | ink/react, dotenv; OTel opt-in | settled (187) |

**Zig:** T9.1's GC glue, alloc helpers, shape tables and growable buffers, plus — since plan-notes
289 — new code that manages memory or must be cross-platform (§0.5). Same C ABI into `libjsrt.a`.
Existing C builtins, math and regexp stay C until a card ports them; codegen never emits Zig.

**Worth considering later — not tasks yet** (ride §12 / the named tripwire):

| Candidate | When |
|---|---|
| Ryū C vendor | §12 ladder (already scheduled; number print) |
| mimalloc/jemalloc | §12 rung 1, non-GC / post-precise-GC paths |
| simdutf (or similar) | only if UTF-16 ops profile hot |
| oxc-parser via napi | only if the `typescript` tripwire (§13) fires |
| LLVM `.ll` emit / LTO+PGO | measure before a new backend (§12 rung 6) |
| QuickJS-NG full interpreter | Phase 8 (already planned; same commit as libregexp) |

**Do not:** rewrite the compiler in another language (parallelizing it is T10.3, not a new language); adopt MMTk / a Rust GC without reopening
§15.4 with measured evidence; add a second RegExp engine beside libregexp; spread Zig beyond
the memory core without a new card.

CI installs Zig 0.16.0 via `mlugg/setup-zig@v2` in `.github/actions/setup`
(skipped on Windows, which never builds the runtime); the version matches the mise pin.

---

## 11b. Phase 10 — `std` library, threads ↔ async, parallel compiler — **[D5 · P1]**

Creator's direction (plan-notes 240). Three related cards, one phase: a low-level **`std`**
surface like a systems stdlib; **OS threads** that interoperate with the existing async /
Promise machinery; and a **threaded host compiler** so compilation uses multiple cores.

This phase is **not sequenced after Phase 8** — §11 is gated and may never start. T10.3
(host-only) can start anytime. T10.1 / T10.2 need a working runtime (Phase 4 ✅) and the
docs-first rule (§15.6). §15.1's top-down rule does not apply here (same exception shape as
Phase 9).

**Not a rewrite of the compiler into another language.** §15.4 / plan-notes 239 stay: the
compiler remains TypeScript + the `typescript` API. "Rewrite with threads" means parallelize
the existing pipeline (`node:worker_threads` / a process pool), not Zig/Rust/Go for codegen.

**Relationship to other phases.**

| Neighbor | How Phase 10 relates |
|---|---|
| Phase 7 FFI | `std` is **first-party** runtime code (`jsrt_std_*`, Zig by default per §0.5), not user `declare` bindings. Phase 7's memory/string/error rules still apply when `std` calls libc. Phase 7's "single-threaded v0" is reopened **only** by T10.2 — FFI callbacks from foreign threads stay undefined until T10.2's bridge exists and 7.2's header is updated. |
| Phase 9 / T9.1 | Threads need a **threads-enabled Boehm** and per-thread stack registration. Prefer landing T9.1's GC glue (or the equivalent C path) before stress-testing T10.2; T10.1's non-thread modules do not wait on Zig. |
| Task 4.6 async | The resume machine, `jsrt_promise_subscribe`, and `jsrt_run_microtasks` are the async half of the bridge. Do not invent a second event loop. |
| §12 ladder | Host compile parallelism (T10.3) is a **developer-time** win; it is not a §12 runtime rung. Measure wall time of `stator build` before/after; keep only if geomean moves. |
| Test262 `SharedArrayBuffer` / `Atomics` / `Worker` | **Out of scope for T10.2 v0.** Those are JS-compat surfaces with their own not-yet codes. `std.thread` / `std.sync` are the Stator-native API; a later card may map SAB/Atomics onto the same primitives. |

### Design: how to implement this best

#### A. `std` is a typed module, backed by Zig — not Node polyfills

1. **Ship `docs/STD.md` before any code** (§15.6). The doc freezes: module path (`std` vs
   `@stator/std`), sync vs Promise APIs, error model (throw `Error` with `code` / `errno`, never
   silent `-1`), and which platforms are supported (POSIX first; Windows only when CI builds
   the runtime there).
2. **Surface shape** (systems std, deliberately smaller than Node):

   | Module | v0 contents | Notes |
   |---|---|---|
   | `std/env` | `get`/`set`/`has`/`unset`, `cwd` | `args` moved to T11.3 as `std/process.argv` (plan-notes 294): the generated `main` takes no `argv` yet |
   | `std/process` | `exit`, `pid`, `abort` | no signals yet |
   | `std/path` | `join`/`dirname`/`basename`/`isAbsolute` | pure TS or tiny C; UTF-16 ↔ bytes at the FS edge only |
   | `std/fs` | sync read/write/stat/mkdir/unlink/rmdir; Promise twins | Promise twins (`readTextAsync`, … — the sync name plus `Async`) are thin `async` wrappers that `await` a thread-pool job (see B) once T10.2 exists; until then importing one is not-yet naming Phase 10 (T10.1 step 5) |
   | `std/time` | `nowMs`, `sleepMs` (sync) | timers in the microtask sense stay out until a macrotask phase exists |
   | `std/sync` | `Mutex`, `CondVar`, `Channel` | with T10.2 |
   | `std/thread` | `spawn`, `join`, `availableParallelism` | with T10.2 |
   | `std/os`, `std/io`, `std/hash`, `std/encoding` | see §11c T11.3 | Phase 11 N1 |
   | `std/loop`, `std/child`, `std/net` | see §11c "Deferred" | Phase 11 N2, deferred |

3. **Implementation layers:** `packages/std/*.ts` (types + thin wrappers users import) →
   compiler recognizes `std/*` as a value-import edge into runtime symbols → Zig backings exporting
   `jsrt_std_*` (§0.5; plan-notes 289). The package layout is §11c's: `packages/std` holds both
   the TS surface and the Zig, and builds `libjsrt_std.a`, linked only when a program imports `std/*`. No second RegExp, no
   Node `fs` semantics chase: match POSIX + document deltas in `STD.md`.
4. **Gate:** unknown `std/foo` is a hard error; partial modules use `not-yet` codes that name
   **Phase 10** as the blocker owner (§15.9).

#### B. Threads + async: one heap, main drains the queue, threads post completions

**Chosen model (settle in `docs/STD.md` + a short `docs/THREADS.md` before code):** shared-heap
**OS threads** with explicit sync, plus a **promise completion bridge** onto the existing
microtask queue. Rejected for v0: isolate-per-worker (heavier, worse "std" feel) and
green-thread M:N (second scheduler beside Task 4.6).

Rules that make async ↔ threads sound:

1. **The main thread owns `jsrt_run_microtasks()`.** Worker threads never drain it.
2. **`std.thread.spawn(fn, ...args)`** runs `fn` on an OS thread. `fn` must be a Stator function
   whose environment is heap-reachable (same discipline as async/generator envs). It may use
   `std/sync` and may call sync `std/fs`. It must not assume TLS frame state from main without
   installing its own `JSRT_FRAME`.
3. **`await thread.join()`** (or `thread.join(): Promise<T>`) parks on a Promise that the worker
   fulfills/rejects by pushing a completion into a **thread-safe MPSC queue**. Main's drain
   (already called after module body / at await boundaries) also pops that queue and settles the
   promises — one mechanism, no second loop.
4. **`std.async.runOnMain(fn)`** (name TBD in the doc) lets a worker schedule a thunk onto the
   main microtask queue. That is the only supported way for a worker to touch Promise reactions
   or non-thread-safe builtins.
5. **Blocking I/O from async code:** prefer `await std.fs.readFile(path)` implemented as
   spawn-join under the hood, so the main thread stays responsive. Do not block main inside an
   async function's sync prefix.
6. **GC:** build/link Boehm with threads; every spawn registers the thread with the collector;
   `_Thread_local jsrt_frame_top` already exists (`docs/VALUE.md`). A thread that allocates without
   registering is a use-after-free waiting to happen — the Check must include a multi-thread
   allocate/collect golden.
7. **Data races on JS objects are undefined** unless guarded by `std/sync` (same honesty as C).
   Document it; do not pretend the runtime is data-race-free.

**Out of v0 (named so they are decisions):** `SharedArrayBuffer` / `Atomics.wait` / `Worker` global;
thread cancellation; priorities; binding a C library's own thread pool without going through
`std.thread` (FFI 7.2 stays single-threaded until explicitly updated).

#### C. Parallel compiler: keep TS, parallelize cold stages, measure

Measured today: small-file `stator build` warm is often **clang-dominated**; large graphs used to
die in `hir/verify` Map copies (parent-linked scopes fixed that). So T10.3 is **not** "thread
everything" — it is a ladder with a measurement gate per step.

| Step | What parallelizes | Constraint |
|---|---|---|
| C0 | Inventory + `STATOR_COMPILE_JOBS` (default `availableParallelism()`, `1` = serial) | Telemetry spans already exist; record baseline wall times on a fixed graph |
| C1 | **Parallel clang** of independent `.c` units after emit | Safest: processes or a fixed worker pool; link stays serial |
| C2 | **Parallel emit** per module once HIR+verify for that module is done | Shared codegen tables must be immutable or cloned per worker |
| C3 | **Parallel lower/verify** per module | `typescript.Program` is **not** thread-safe — one Program per worker (process pool) **or** a single-threaded typecheck then sharded HIR. Prefer process pool over `worker_threads` if the API holds native state |
| C4 | Program / parse cache stays; workers inherit immutable snapshots | Never share a mutable checker across threads |

**Do not:** rewrite the compiler in Zig/Rust; put clang inside the runtime; claim a speedup
without before/after numbers on the same machine.

**Check (phase-level):** `docs/STD.md` + `docs/THREADS.md` exist; at least `std/env` + `std/path`
compile and run; one golden shows `spawn` + `await join` interleaving with `Promise` reactions;
`stator build` on a multi-file fixture is ≥1.5× faster wall-clock with `STATOR_COMPILE_JOBS>1`
than with `=1` on a quiet machine (or the note explains why the floor was not met and which
step remains). `pnpm run ci` green.

~~**T10.1. `std` low-level API (sans threads).**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-10-02** — evidence in
[done.md](done.md) → Phase 10 T10.1 (plan-notes 284, 294, 307).
`std/env`, `std/path`, `std/process`, sync `std/fs` and `std/time` live in `packages/std`. The
`std/fs` Promise twins (`readTextAsync`, …) are `STA1214` naming Phase 10 until T10.2 implements
them as `async` wrappers over the thread pool (docs/STD.md §2).

### T10.2. OS threads + async bridge — **[D5]**

Depends on: T10.1's docs (threads chapters), Task 4.6 machinery, threads-enabled GC.

Steps:

1. Write `docs/THREADS.md` — the seven rules in Design B, plus Boehm build flags.
2. Runtime: thread registry, MPSC completion queue, `jsrt_thread_spawn` / `join` promise.
3. `std/sync` (`Mutex`, `CondVar`, bounded `Channel`).
4. `std/thread.spawn` / `join` / `availableParallelism`.
5. Bridge: `await join` + `runOnMain`; golden where a worker resolves a Promise the main `await`s,
   and an async function offloads CPU work via spawn-join.
6. Update Phase 7 Task 7.2 step 6 text/header when foreign threads may call in **only** via the
   bridge (or keep "undefined" until a 7.2 follow-up — record the choice in plan-notes).
7. Stress: N threads allocating under GC; ASan/UBSan where available.

**Check:** goldens byte-stable where Node has an analogue (Promise side); thread-only fixtures
use Stator's own oracle. Multi-thread GC stress does not crash under ASan.

### T10.3. Threaded / parallel host compiler — **[D4]**

Independent of T10.1/T10.2. Host Node only.

Steps:

1. Baseline: wall time of `stator build` on a fixed multi-file fixture at `STATOR_COMPILE_JOBS=1`
   with spans (frontend / lower / verify / emit / clang / link).
2. C1 — parallel clang; keep if ≥1.3× on that fixture.
3. C2 — parallel emit if emit shows in the profile.
4. C3 — sharded lower/verify via process pool if typecheck/HIR dominate; document the Program
   isolation choice.
5. CI: one job runs `STATOR_COMPILE_JOBS=2` smoke so races fail the build; default CI may stay
   serial for log readability.

**Check:** documented before/after numbers in plan-notes; `STATOR_COMPILE_JOBS=1` preserves
byte-identical emitted C for the fixture; CI green.

## 11c. Phase 11 — `--node`: the Node platform — **[D5 · P1]**

Creator's direction (2026-10-02, plan-notes 286, decided in 289). A program may use the Node
platform: CommonJS `require` / `module.exports`, `process`, `Buffer`, timers and the `node:*`
built-in modules. The first target is TypeScript 6.0.3's own `tsc` bundle.

**Decided (plan-notes 289, from T11.0's research `docs/research/node-mode.md`):**

- `--node` is a **platform flag orthogonal to `--mode`**, not a third mode. It decides which
  specifiers resolve (`node:*`, bare built-ins, CommonJS `require`), which globals exist, and
  whether `main` ends by running the loop. Below the frontend gate `node:*` modules are just
  modules (§0.8 holds).
- **Two layers, `std` first.** Typed `std/*` modules backed by **Zig** (§0.5). `node:*` modules
  are strict TypeScript over `std`, with no C or Zig of their own, written **from scratch** — no
  vendored Node `lib/` JS (§0.10).
- **Order:** P0 prerequisites → N1 (sync `tsc`). N2 (loop, child processes, streams) is
  deferred; N3 (net/http/tls/zlib, `worker_threads`, `vm`) is not planned.
- Coverage is tracked in **`docs/NODE.md`**, generated from the pinned Node and checked in `ci`
  (AGENTS.md golden rule 11).

**Packages.** The work is decomposed by package; each card names the one package it changes
(tests and docs ride along). Dependencies point one way only:
`node` → `std` → `runtime`; `compiler` resolves `std/*` and `node:*` but never imports them.

| Package | Language | Holds | Must not |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `packages/runtime` | C11 + Zig | values, GC, builtins, **typed arrays** (T11.1) | know `std` or Node |
| `packages/std` (new, T11.2) | strict TS surface + Zig backings → `libjsrt_std.a` | `std/env`, `path`, `process`, `fs`, `time`, `os`, `io`, `hash`, `encoding` | know Node; mimic Node option bags or error strings |
| `packages/node` (new, T11.6) | strict TS only | `node:*` modules, Node globals (`process`, `Buffer`, timers), the CJS runtime helpers | contain C, Zig or JS; reach `runtime` except through `std` |
| `packages/compiler` | strict TS | `--node` flag, `std/*` + `node:*` resolution, CommonJS lowering (T11.5), js-mode coverage (T11.4) | contain platform semantics (those live in `node`) |
| `packages/tests` | strict TS | goldens, `node_coverage.json` claims, the `docs/NODE.md` generator | — |

Each new package is a pnpm workspace member and a moon project with its own `typecheck`,
`lint` and build tasks, so moon caches it alone (plan-notes 204). `docs/architecture/packages.d2`
gains each package in the change that creates it.

~~**T11.0. Research: what `--node` means and what it costs.**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-10-02** —
evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 11 T11.0 (plan-notes 288, decision 289).

~~**T11.1. `packages/runtime`: typed arrays.**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-10-02** — `ArrayBuffer` +
`Uint8Array`; evidence in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 11 T11.1. Still open from the card: the rest
of the `TypedArray` family lands with the card whose corpus first needs it (docs/SUBSET.md lists
the refused surface, `builtins_coverage.json` counts it as missing).

~~**T11.2. `packages/std`: the real `std/*` package.**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-10-02** — evidence in
[done.md](done.md) → Phase 11 T11.2 (plan-notes 294).

### T11.3. `packages/std`: the N1 modules — **[D3]**

Depends on T11.1, T11.2. Zig backings, POSIX first (STD.md §4). Errors throw with a stable
`code` (STD.md §3).

| Module | Functions |
| --- | --- |
| `std/process` (extend) | `argv`, `execPath`, `platform`, `arch`, `ppid`, `hrtimeNs`, `memoryUsage`, `exitCode` |
| `std/fs` (extend) | `open`/`read`/`write`/`close` on fds, `readdir`, `realpath`, `utimes`, `exists`, bytes reads (`unlink`, `rmdir` and UTF-8 text reads landed with T11.2) |
| `std/os` | `platform`, `arch`, `release`, `hostname`, `homedir`, `tmpdir`, `cpuCount`, `totalMemory`, `eol` |
| `std/io` | `stdin`/`stdout`/`stderr` fds, `write`, `read`, `isatty`, `terminalSize` |
| `std/hash` | `sha256`, `sha1`, `md5` over bytes or strings; `randomBytes` |
| `std/encoding` | UTF-8 / latin1 / base64 / base64url / hex ↔ bytes |

**Check:** a golden per module against Node's equivalent (nondeterministic results — `hostname`,
`pid`, `randomBytes` — proved by unit-test ranges, as `test:builtins` carves them out).

### T11.4. `packages/compiler`: js-mode coverage for the `tsc` bundle — **[D5]**

The largest P0 item (plan-notes 286). Prerequisites run in their own sessions: the `STA4072`
stack overflow on large inputs and the js-mode false rejections (the TS2630/TS2698 pair landed,
plan-notes 297; the 45 `STA0012` left on `_tsc.js` are Node globals, the platform's work). Then
the `STA1214` families on
`_tsc.js`: method calls on inferred shapes (402), assignment to non-variables (518),
unsupported globals (111), spreads (~190), Map/Set from iterables (71), `new` on non-class (50),
index access on non-array (33), `Object.*` (24), destructuring (31), class expressions (~8).
Each family is its own sub-step with its own fixtures — none of it is Node-specific.

**Check:** `stator explain _tsc.js --mode=js --json` lists no `STA1214` in `diagnostics` and ends
with a verdict, not `STA0013`/`STA4072` (PR #44 names the checker's stack overflow `STA0013`).
Baseline 2026-10-02 at `--stack-size=7600`: 1 589 diagnostics — 1 541 `STA1214`, 47 `STA0012`,
1 `STA1210` (plan-notes 291). Every landed
construct has decision tests in both modes + a golden (Testing rules).

### T11.5. `packages/compiler`: the `--node` flag and CommonJS — **[D4]**

Depends on T11.2. **Re-scoped by T12.0** (question 4, plan-notes 296; `docs/BUNDLER.md` §4):
the bundler converts CommonJS. Rolldown wraps each module as a function over
`(exports, module)`, and it already turns static `require` into graph edges, decides `"type"`
and gives CJS cycles Node's partial `exports`. Stator writes none of that. A CommonJS project
file (Node's rule: `.cjs`, `"type": "commonjs"`, or `.js` without ES-module syntax) is routed
to the bundler by T12.1.

Steps:

- **The flag.** `--node` on the CLI and `explain`. Under `--node` an unlanded `node:*` or
  global member is a `not-yet` diagnostic naming T11.6, so `explain`'s `diagnostics` lists
  platform gaps (`docs/MODES.md` §6).
- **The Node globals.** These include `__filename` and `__dirname`, which lift T12.1's
  `not-yet` under `--node`. They apply both in CommonJS project files and in the vendor
  module. Their value must not bake a build-machine path into the binary (creator, 2026-10-02,
  BUNDLER.md §9). Decide whether the value is relative to the executable or comes from
  `import.meta.url`, then record it in `MODES.md`.
- **Resolution.** `node:*` and bare built-ins resolve to `packages/node`, both as ESM imports
  in project files and in the vendor bundle. The bundle reaches them as
  `import * as m from "path"` plus `m.default` (`esmExternalRequirePlugin`), so built-ins need
  a default export.
- **`require` at run time.** `import.meta.url` + `node:module.createRequire` give a `require`
  over built-ins only. It serves Rolldown's `__require` for computed `require(expr)`, and
  anything that is not a built-in throws Node's `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. A computed require of a
  bundled file cannot resolve: Node itself fails on the bundle, as measured in T12.0.
- **`STA1110`** narrows to "without `--node`". In `ts` mode, and under `--bundler=none`, it
  stays. New not-yet codes are allocated in `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md`.

Docs: `MODES.md` (platform section), `SUBSET.md`, `DIAGNOSTICS.md`, `HOW-IT-WORKS.md`.

**Check:** decision tests for `require` in all four mode × platform cells. Goldens, byte-for-byte
vs Node: `createRequire` of a built-in, a computed `require` hit (a built-in) and miss
(`MODULE_NOT_FOUND`). The CJS cycle and `module.exports` replacement goldens moved to T12.3.

### T11.5a. `packages/compiler`: per-module namespaces — **[D4]**

Creator's direction (2026-10-02, plan-notes 302). This is a prerequisite of T11.6. Today one
program has **one** namespace, so three things go wrong:
- Importing a module reserves all of its top-level names, exported or not, for the whole program.
  A user `function get()` next to `import { has } from "std/env"` is `STA1214`.
- Every aliasing shape is `STA1214` (docs/SUBSET.md, "Renamed/default/namespace imports" and
  "Re-exports" rows), so a library cannot hide its helpers or rename what it exports.
- `packages/node` would hit both on every module (plan-notes 294).

Steps:
1. **Per-module symbols.** Every module's top-level bindings get a module-qualified C name. Two
   modules may then declare the same name, and a module's unexported names are invisible to
   others. Diagnostics and `#line` mapping keep the source name.
2. **Aliasing imports.** `import { x as y }`, default imports, and `import * as ns` as a static
   namespace object. A static `ns.x` resolves at compile time, like the `import()` namespace from
   Phase 5 step 10. A namespace that escapes as a value uses that same `HObject`
   (`namespace: true`).
3. **Aliasing exports.** `export { x as y }`, `export default`, and re-exports:
   `export { x } from`, `export * from` (with ES ambiguity rules: a name exported twice by `*` is
   dropped, not an error) and `export * as ns from`. This takes over T12.1 step 3's
   `export { a as b }`. Whichever card lands first owns it, and the other cites it.
4. **Both modes, both kinds of graph.** The same rules apply to `ts`-mode modules, `js`-mode
   modules and mixed graphs. `std/*` and the T12.1 vendor module are ordinary modules here,
   with no special case.
5. **Docs.** Flip the SUBSET.md rows. The Phase 5 step 12 line that still owns `import * as ns`
   cites this card. Update MODES.md if init order or live bindings show a Node difference.

**Check:**
- A user `function get()` beside `import { has } from "std/env"` builds.
- Two modules with a same-named private helper build and run as under Node.
- Decision tests flip `not-yet` → `static` for every aliasing shape in both modes, removing the
  `// @expected-fail` markers in the same commit.
- Goldens cover renamed imports and exports, default, `import * as ns`, `export *` with an
  ambiguous name, and a re-export chain. Each matches Node byte for byte.
- `STA1214` is no longer emitted for those shapes, and the `test262` `language/module-code`
  pass count rises, recorded in plan-notes.

### T11.6. `packages/node`: the N1 wrappers — **[D4]**

Depends on T11.1, T11.3, T11.5, T11.5a. Create `packages/node` (strict TS over `std`, written from
scratch). Surface, from the corpus (`docs/NODE.md` **tsc** column): `node:fs` sync subset (the 15
functions `tsc` calls), `node:path` (posix), `node:os`, `node:perf_hooks.performance`,
`crypto.createHash`, `process` (`argv`/`env`/`cwd`/`exit`/`exitCode`/`platform`/`pid`/
`stdout.write`/`memoryUsage`/`nextTick`), `Buffer.from`/`toString`, timers. Without a loop (N2),
`nextTick` and zero-delay timers drain after `main` like microtasks; a real delay is not-yet.
Every member lands with a golden and a `node_coverage.json` claim; `docs/NODE.md` regenerates in
the same change.

**Check:** `tsc --version` and `tsc -p` on a small fixture project, compiled by Stator, print
byte-for-byte what `node _tsc.js` prints on Node 26.7.0; `docs/NODE.md` slice N1 at 100%.

### T11.7. Node's own test suite, synced and run through vitest — **[D3 · P1]**

Creator's direction (2026-10-02, plan-notes 305). The `node:*` wrappers are proven by Node's own
tests, synced at the pinned version, not by hand-written copies.

1. **Sync, don't copy.** `packages/tests/node-suite/pin.json` pins the tag matching
   `.node-version` (v26.7.0). A strict-TS fetch script downloads the selected
   `test/parallel/test-*.js` files and the `test/fixtures` they read. The corpus is fetched, not
   vendored (gitignored), the same way Test262 is (Task 6.1). A Node bump re-pins it, and the diff
   of results is the review.
2. **Selection.** A checked-in expectations file lists each selected test as `pass`, `fail` or
   `skip` with a reason. At v26.7.0, `test/parallel` has 4 641 `test-*` files, and 615 of them
   have a name starting with an N1 module (`fs`, `path`, `os`, `buffer`, `process`,
   `crypto-hash`, `timers`, `perf-hooks`). Start with `path`, then follow T11.6's order. Tests that
   need `// Flags: --expose-internals`, child processes or the network are `skip` until N2.
3. **The harness, in strict TS.** `require('../common')` resolves to
   `packages/tests/node-suite/common.ts`, a strict-TS implementation of the `common` helpers the
   selected tests use (`mustCall`, `mustNotCall`, `expectsError`, `tmpdir`, platform flags). It
   grows with the selection. `node:assert` (`ok`, `strictEqual`, `deepStrictEqual`, `throws`,
   `rejects`) lands in `packages/node` as part of this card.
4. **vitest drives it.** The runner generates one vitest test per selected file. Each test builds
   the file with `--mode=js --node`, runs the binary, and passes on exit 0. The same file must also
   pass under the pinned Node, so a test that fails on the host is `skip`, never `fail`.
5. **Ratchet and coverage.** A `pass` that starts failing fails the run. A `fail` that starts
   passing must be flipped in the same change, as Test262's ratchet does. `docs/NODE.md` gains a
   "node tests" column with passes over the selected count per module.

Depends on T11.5 (`--node`, CommonJS through the T12 bundler) and T11.6. The harness and `path`
can land as soon as `node:path` exists.

**Check:** `pnpm run test:node-suite` runs the selection through vitest against the pinned corpus,
and its pass count is recorded in plan-notes; `docs/NODE.md` shows the column; a hand-flipped
expectation fails the run.

**Deferred — N2 (not a card yet).** `std/loop` written in Zig (the creator chose an own loop
over libuv: kqueue/epoll first, Windows when the runtime builds there), real timers and
immediates, `std/child`, `fs.promises`, `fs.watch`, `node:events`, `node:stream`, `node:util`,
`node:url`, `node:tty`, `node:readline`. **Open research before its card:** T10.2's worker
pool + MPSC completion queue versus the loop's own I/O pool — one must own the other (plan-notes
289). **Not planned — N3:** `net`, `http(s)`, `tls`, `dns`, `zlib`, `worker_threads`, `vm`.

---

## 11d. Phase 12 — `js` mode builds through a bundler — **[D4]**

Creator's direction (2026-10-02, plan-notes 290): in `js` mode a bundler produces **one file**,
tree-shaken, CommonJS converted, `node_modules` resolved, and Stator compiles it. Any bundler
can plug in through a Stator API. The default integration is a new **`packages/vite-stator`**
package.

**Design (T12.0, plan-notes 296, `docs/BUNDLER.md`): bundle the dependencies, not the project.**
Stator keeps compiling the project's `.ts` and ESM `.js` as its own graph. The bundler gets two
kinds of input:

- every **package** import, meaning a bare specifier that is not `node:*`, a built-in or
  `std/*`;
- every **CommonJS** project file.

Both go into one generated vendor entry. The adapter bundles it into one ESM module plus a
source map, and that module joins the graph as one `js`-mode module. A graph with neither kind
never calls the bundler.

The reasons are measured (BUNDLER.md §1):

- Bundling the whole graph strips project `.ts` (`fib` static → dynamic).
- It drops `STA2001` boundary checks.
- It breaks existing goldens through Rolldown's helpers.
- It saves nothing, since Stator's DCE already tree-shakes project code.

Decided by the creator (2026-10-02, BUNDLER.md §9, plan-notes 296):

- "one file" means the dependencies only, so this design stands;
- `__filename`/`__dirname` are a `not-yet` diagnostic until `--node` (T11.5), and no path is
  baked into a binary;
- the package evaluation-order deviation is documented only, with no card to close it.

The phase is not sequenced after Phase 8 (§15.1 exception, as Phases 9–11). It touches only
`js` mode: `ts` mode keeps its own module graph, because a bundler strips the types `ts` mode
compiles from.

| Package | Holds | Must not |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `packages/compiler` | the bundler API (`statorc/api`), the `BundlerAdapter` interface, `--bundler`, the vendor entry, source-map-driven diagnostics and `#line` | import any bundler — adapters are loaded by name at run time, so the §0.9 budget stays `typescript` only |
| `packages/vite-stator` (new) | a Vite plugin (`vite build` → native binary) and the default `BundlerAdapter` | contain compiler logic — it calls `statorc/api` and nothing else |

~~**T12.0. Design: the bundler contract.**~~ ✅ **landed 2026-10-02** — evidence in
[done.md](done.md) → Phase 12 T12.0 (plan-notes 296; `docs/BUNDLER.md`).

### T12.1. `packages/compiler`: the bundler API — **[D4]**

Depends on T12.0. Contract: `docs/BUNDLER.md` §5–§7.

1. **The API.** `statorc/api`: a programmatic `compile` that takes an optional vendor bundle
   (`{ code, map, inputs }`), and the adapter interface
   `BundlerAdapter = { name, bundle(entry: { code, resolveDir }, { external }) → Promise<{ code, map, inputs }> }`.
2. **The vendor entry.** After the program loads, collect the package imports and route the
   CommonJS project files. Generate the vendor entry:
   - named imports become `export { a } from 'p'`;
   - default and namespace imports get mangled names;
   - a name is mangled only on collision.
3. **The vendor module.** Add the bundle as one virtual `js`-mode module and rebind the
   imports to its exports. Lower `export { a as b }`, which is STA1214 today and is the form
   Rolldown emits for renamed exports (T11.5a step 3 delivers it too; whichever lands first owns it).
4. **The CLI.** `--bundler=vite|none|<module>` on `build` and `explain`:
   - the default in `js` mode is `vite`, loading `vite-stator`;
   - in `ts` mode the flag is `STA0004`;
   - the adapter loads only when step 2 found something;
   - `STA0014` means the adapter cannot be loaded, and its message names the package;
   - `STA0015` means the bundle step failed, with the bundler's message passed through.
5. **Source maps.** Diagnostics, `#line` and runtime call-site strings in the vendor module
   map through the source map (`node:module` `SourceMap`, wrapped once in `src/support/`;
   stability 1.1). A position with no mapping says it sits in a bundler runtime helper, never
   a user file.
6. **The cache.** The program-cache key (Task 6.9) adds the sha256 of the vendor `code`.
7. **`__filename`/`__dirname`.** Without `--node`, a free read of either in a project file
   or in the vendor module is a `not-yet` diagnostic naming T11.5 (BUNDLER.md §4, §9). Inside
   the vendor module it is reported at the mapped position. The code is allocated in
   `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md` when this lands.

   Today such a read compiles as `dynamic`, and the binary throws `ReferenceError` where Node
   prints the path. No path is ever baked into the binary.

Docs: `HOW-IT-WORKS.md`; `MODES.md`, covering packages, the vendor module and the
package-evaluation-order deviation (BUNDLER.md §1, documented only, no card closes it), the
latter next to top-level-await interleaving in §5; `DIAGNOSTICS.md` (STA0014/STA0015 move from
planned to emitted, plus step 7's code); `pipeline.d2` (a dependency-bundling stage before the frontend in
`js` mode).

**Check:**

- Unit tests drive `compile` and the vendor-entry generator through a stub adapter.
- Every existing `js` golden passes byte-for-byte under `--bundler=none` **and** under the
  default, with Vite not installed. None of them imports a package, so the adapter must not
  load.
- A diagnostic inside a vendored module reports the original file and line. One inside a
  runtime helper says "no source mapping".
- `STA0014` is raised for a package import when the adapter is absent.
- Decision tests: `__filename`/`__dirname` are `not-yet` in a project `.js` without `--node`.

### T12.2. `packages/vite-stator`: the default integration — **[D3]**

Depends on T12.1. New workspace package, strict TS (§0.10). `vite` is a `peerDependency`
(plan-notes entry: the integration *is* Vite, no few lines replace it). It ships:

- the adapter `stator build --mode=js` uses by default, configured per BUNDLER.md §2:
  - an SSR build with `ssr.noExternal: true` and `ssr.target: 'node'`. Library mode is wrong:
    it stubs `node:*` out;
  - Rolldown output `format: 'es'`, `codeSplitting: false` and `topLevelVar: false`;
  - `minify: false`, `sourcemap: true`, `std/*` external;
  - Vite's `esmExternalRequirePlugin` for built-ins;
  - no `__filename`/`__dirname` transform. They stay free, and T12.1 reports them as
    `not-yet` (BUNDLER.md §9);
- the `stator()` Vite plugin (`vite build` produces the native binary);
- an example under `examples/vite/` with its README.

**Check:**

- New goldens with a `node_modules` package pass through the default adapter, byte-for-byte
  vs Node: named, default and namespace imports, and two packages sharing a dependency (one
  instance).
- `examples/vite` builds a binary with `vite build`.
- Tree-shaking, measured on a package, because project code is already tree-shaken by
  Stator's DCE (BUNDLER.md §1, 93 976 B both ways). Import 1 of 40 functions from a package:
  - the vendor module holds only that function;
  - the binary is within 1% of the same function written in the project.
  The numbers go in plan-notes.

### T12.3. `packages/compiler`: Rolldown's output compiles — **[D4]**

Depends on T12.1, and overlaps T11.4's `Object.*` and method-call families. Do those first,
where they are the same constructs. Each item below is measured in T12.0 (`docs/BUNDLER.md`
§2, §4, §8), and each lands with decision tests in both modes plus a golden:

- **`var X = class {}` / `let X = class {}`.** Rolldown emits every top-level class this way;
  only `const` lowers today.
- **The CJS interop helpers.** `__commonJSMin`, `__toESM` and `__copyProps` need
  `Object.create`, `Object.defineProperty` with getter descriptors,
  `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor`, `Object.getOwnPropertyNames`, `Object.getPrototypeOf`,
  `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call` and `Function.prototype.bind`.
- **The dynamic-import namespace helpers.** `__esmMin` and `__exportAll` need
  `Symbol.toStringTag` and a zero-argument `Promise.resolve()`.
- **`import.meta.url`.**
- **A computed `export default`.**

Out of scope: `__filename`/`__dirname`. They stay `not-yet` until T11.5 (BUNDLER.md §9), so no
golden here reads them.

**Check:** CommonJS goldens through the default adapter, byte-for-byte vs Node:

- `exports.x`;
- `module.exports` replacement;
- a nested `require`;
- a CJS cycle that exposes partial `exports`;
- a `.cjs` project entry;
- a package with an inlined dynamic `import()`;
- a package with a top-level class.

`explain` on T12.0's `cjs` spike bundle lists no `STA1214`.

## 11e. Phase 13 — Web API with a pluggable render API — **[D5 · P3]**

**Priority (creator, 2026-10-02, plan-notes 305):** Phase 11 (`--node`) comes before this phase.
When an agent picks its next card, a Phase 11 card wins over any Phase 13 card, `webapi` and
`renderer-clay` alike.

Creator's direction (2026-10-02, plan-notes 298). Stator programs get the Web platform's DOM and
CSS as a **separate package**. That package knows nothing about pixels: it talks to a renderer
through a **render API**, so any renderer can plug in. The default renderer is
[Clay](https://github.com/nicbarker/clay), in its own package. DOM and CSS come first. The other
Web APIs are low priority and get no card yet (end of this section).

The phase is not sequenced after Phase 8 (§15.1 exception, as Phases 9–12). It works in both
modes: the packages are typed code, and nothing below the frontend gate learns about them (§0.8).

| Package | Holds | Must not |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `packages/webapi` (new) | DOM + CSS in **strict TypeScript** (§0.9, §0.10), compiled by Stator like `node:*` (§11c), plus the render API: the `Renderer` interface and the data it exchanges | draw, measure fonts or call C — every pixel, glyph and input event crosses the render API |
| `packages/renderer-clay` (new) | the default `Renderer`: a strict-TS adapter over FFI (Phase 7) to Zig glue (§0.5) around vendored `clay.h` (C, Zlib) and one drawing backend | hold DOM or CSS semantics — it sees only what the render API hands it |

### T13.0. Design: the render API and the DOM/CSS subset — **[D4]**

Docs first (§15.6): `docs/WEBAPI-DESIGN.md`, settled with a measured spike. The spike renders one fixture
(a flex row, text, a border, a scroll container) through `renderer-clay` and dumps Clay's render
commands. Questions it must answer:

1. **Where layout lives.** Clay is a layout engine: it takes a tree of sized boxes and returns
   positioned render commands (rectangle, border, text, image, scissor start/end, custom). Either
   `webapi` hands the renderer a styled box tree and the renderer lays it out, or `webapi` lays out
   and the renderer only draws. Pick one, and say how `getBoundingClientRect` and hit testing get
   their geometry back.
2. **The render API.** The `Renderer` interface (`webapi` owns it; renderers implement it):
   frame begin/end, the tree or command format, text measurement (Clay asks for it through
   `Clay_SetMeasureTextFunction`), images and fonts as resources, input events coming back, and
   damage tracking (Clay commands carry element ids so unchanged ones can be skipped). A renderer
   is chosen at **build** time (`--renderer=clay|<package>`, default `clay`) and linked statically,
   because typed code has no run-time plugin loading. A missing renderer package is a `STA0xxx`
   naming it, allocated in `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md`.
3. **The DOM subset.** First: `Node`, `Element`, `Text`, `Document`, tree mutation, attributes,
   `classList`, `textContent`, `querySelector(All)`, events with capture and bubble, `style`,
   `getBoundingClientRect`. What is a `not-yet` diagnostic (the T11.5 pattern, so `explain` lists
   the gap) and what is never planned.
4. **The CSS subset and its Clay mapping.** Selectors (type, class, id, descendant, child),
   specificity, cascade, inheritance, computed values. Layout properties map onto Clay's model:
   `display: flex` direction, `gap` → `childGap`, `padding`, `width`/`height` → fixed / percent /
   grow (`flex-grow`) / fit (`auto`), alignment, `overflow: scroll` → Clay scroll containers,
   `position: absolute` → Clay floating elements. Plus colors, borders, `border-radius`, fonts.
   Write the table of properties Clay cannot express, and what each one does instead.
5. **How a program reaches it.** Explicit imports (`import { document } from 'webapi'`) or a
   platform flag that makes `document`/`window` global, parallel to `--node` (§11c). Both modes.
6. **The drawing backend.** Clay does not draw. Its repository ships renderers for raylib, SDL2,
   SDL3, sokol, cairo, GLES3, win32 GDI, termbox2, terminal, web and Playdate. Pick the first one
   for macOS, Linux and Windows (§0.5's cross-platform rule), what it adds to the toolchain, and
   whether a terminal backend serves as the headless test target.
7. **The frame loop.** Input events and redraw need a loop. Either wait for N2's own loop
   (§11c, Zig) or run a frame loop inside the renderer first, and say how it hands events to the
   promise/microtask machinery (Task 4.6) without becoming a second event loop.
8. **The oracle.** Node has no DOM. DOM semantics: a web-platform-tests (WPT) slice, pinned the
   way Test262 is (Task 6.1, `packages/tests/test262/pin.json`), or a DOM implementation run under Node as a **dev-only** oracle
   (allowed: an oracle is not our source, §0.10). Layout: box geometry compared with a headless
   browser, with the tolerance written down, because Clay's model is not CSS layout.
9. **Parsing CSS.** An existing parser is JavaScript and cannot ship in `webapi` (§0.10). Confirm
   there is no strict-TS one that Stator compiles; otherwise write one per CSS Syntax Level 3 and
   say why in plan-notes.

**Check:** `docs/WEBAPI-DESIGN.md` answers 1–9 with the spike's numbers; plan-notes records the choices;
T13.1–T13.5 are edited to match; `docs/README.md` lists the new doc.

### T13.1. `packages/webapi`: the DOM — **[D4]**

Depends on T13.0 and T13.5. New workspace package, strict TS (§0.9, §0.10), compiled by Stator.
The DOM subset from T13.0 §3, against a recording renderer (T13.3's test double) so no pixels are
needed. Every member it proves is claimed in `webapi_coverage.json` and `docs/WEBAPI.md` is
regenerated in the same change (T13.5) — the rule for every later Phase 13 card too.

**Check:** the T13.0 DOM oracle slice passes in both modes, byte-for-byte against the oracle;
every unsupported member surfaces in `explain` as `not-yet`, not as `STA0012`.

### T13.2. `packages/webapi`: CSS — **[D4]**

Depends on T13.1. Parsing, selector matching, cascade, inheritance and computed style for the
T13.0 §4 subset; `getComputedStyle`; `<style>` and inline `style`.

**Check:** the T13.0 CSS oracle slice passes (computed values byte-for-byte); a selector-matching
benchmark over a 10 000-element tree is recorded in `packages/tests/bench/`.

### T13.3. The render API and a recording renderer — **[D3]**

Depends on T13.0; lands before T13.4. The `Renderer` interface in `packages/webapi`, and a
recording renderer in `packages/tests` that prints what it is handed, one line per command. It
is the test double for T13.1–T13.2 and the contract test every renderer must pass.

**Check:** golden fixtures dump the recorded stream for each T13.0 §4 property; a second renderer
can be written against the interface alone (`docs/WEBAPI-DESIGN.md` has the worked example).

### T13.4. `packages/renderer-clay`: the default renderer — **[D5]**

Depends on T13.3. New workspace package:

- `clay.h` vendored under `vendor/` at a pinned tag (v0.14 unless T13.0 finds a reason to pin a
  later commit), fetched by the runtime's vendor update script (`pnpm run vendor:update`), patched
  only via plan-notes. It compiles with `-Wall` alone, as all vendored C (plan-notes 101).
- Zig glue (§0.5): the arena (`Clay_MinMemorySize` → `Clay_CreateArenaWithCapacityAndMemory` →
  `Clay_Initialize`), the text-measure callback, and the drawing backend from T13.0 §6. Exports a
  C ABI only, as `runtime/src/*.zig` does.
- A strict-TS adapter that implements `Renderer` over the Zig glue through Phase 7 FFI.
- An example under `examples/webapi/` with its README; `docs/TOOLCHAIN.md` gains the backend.

**Check:** the T13.3 contract test passes; T13.0's layout oracle agrees within the documented
tolerance on every fixture; `examples/webapi` builds a native binary on macOS, Linux and Windows
that renders and reacts to a click; ASan/UBSan clean.

### T13.5. `docs/WEBAPI.md`: generated Web API coverage — **[D2]**

Depends on T13.0; lands before T13.1 claims its first member. The Web-platform counterpart of
`docs/NODE.md` (AGENTS.md rule 11): coverage in % per area, interface and member, generated, and
checked in `ci`.

- **The denominator comes from a pinned source, not a hand list.** Every interface in
  `lib.dom.d.ts` from the pinned `typescript` (6.0.3 ships it: 1 520 top-level `interface`
  declarations), with its constructor, static and instance members, read through the TypeScript
  API. No new dependency, and a `typescript` bump moves the denominator visibly. As with
  `NODE.md`, forgetting a member cannot raise the percentage.
- **Grouped by area.** DOM and CSSOM (CSSOM View included) come first, because those are the rows
  this phase delivers; everything else sits under one "other Web APIs" heading. The interface →
  area map is checked in next to the claims, and an interface missing from it is a generator
  error, not a silent "other". If that map cannot be kept honest by hand, T13.0 may pick
  `@webref/idl` (W3C Webref's per-spec IDL) as the source instead: a new dev dependency with its
  own plan-notes entry.
- **The numerator comes from claims.** `packages/tests/golden/webapi_coverage.json` maps interface
  → member → the fixtures that prove it against T13.0 §8's oracle, or to `{ "not-yet": "T13.x" }`.
  A claim whose fixture is missing or never mentions the member fails the generator, as
  `coverage-claims.ts` already does for Node.
- **One generator, not two.** Table rendering, the staleness check and claim validation are shared
  with `node-coverage.ts` through one extracted helper (`pnpm run dupes`); only the denominator
  readers differ.
- `pnpm run docs:webapi` writes the file; `pnpm run test:webapi-coverage` (in `ci`, and a moon
  task beside `node-coverage`) fails when it is stale. AGENTS.md gains rule 12 mirroring rule 11;
  `docs/README.md` lists the file as generated.

**Check:** `pnpm run test:webapi-coverage` passes on a fresh tree and fails after a hand edit of
`docs/WEBAPI.md`; before T13.1 the doc shows 0% over the full denominator; a claim naming a
missing fixture fails with the claim's path.

### T13.6. Web-platform-tests for `webapi`, synced and run through vitest — **[D3 · P3]**

Creator's direction (2026-10-02, plan-notes 305). This is T13.0 §8's DOM oracle, made concrete.
It follows T11.7's design, so the two suites share one fetch, expectation and ratchet mechanism
(Task 6.16: one helper, not two).

1. **Sync.** `packages/tests/wpt/pin.json` pins a web-platform-tests commit, fetched and not
   vendored. Scope is `dom/` (937 files: 651 `.html`, 66 `.any.js`/`.window.js`) and `css/cssom/`
   (352 files: 295 `.html`, 1 `.any.js`), counted at `c5e80ef1dca9`.
2. **Script tests first.** `.any.js` and `.window.js` need no markup and run first. `.html` tests
   need their markup turned into a document. T13.0 decides between an HTML parser in `webapi`
   (which `innerHTML` would also need) and a dev-only pre-pass at fetch time that turns markup into
   DOM-building calls. Until then `.html` tests are `skip`.
3. **The harness, in strict TS.** A strict-TS `testharness` subset (`test`, `promise_test`,
   `async_test`, `assert_*`, `done`) replaces `testharness.js` for the selected tests.
4. **vitest drives it,** with the same per-file ratchet as T11.7. `docs/WEBAPI.md` (T13.5) gains a
   "WPT" column.

Depends on T13.1 and T13.5. Lower priority than T11.7 (Phase 11 first).

**Check:** `pnpm run test:wpt` runs the selection through vitest against the pinned commit, and
its pass count is recorded in plan-notes; `docs/WEBAPI.md` shows the column; a hand-flipped
expectation fails the run.

**Low priority — the other Web APIs (not cards yet).** `URL`, `TextEncoder`/`TextDecoder`, timers,
`fetch`, `WebSocket`, storage, `Canvas`, `structuredClone` and the rest. They land in
`packages/webapi` after T13.4, each as its own card. Where `std/*` (§11b) or `node:*` (§11c)
already provides the primitive, the Web API wraps it rather than duplicating it.

---

## 11f. Phase 14 — A JavaScript interpreter in strict TypeScript: `js` mode's second fallback — **[D5]**

Creator's direction (2026-10-02, plan-notes 300). Write a QuickJS-class JavaScript interpreter as
a **separate package in strict TypeScript**, compiled by Stator, and use it as an additional
fallback in `js` mode. It runs what compiled code cannot: `eval`, `new Function`, and later the
constructs that are `not-yet` today (`STA1206` and the rest of `STA12xx` that T14.0 assigns to
it).

**Where it sits.** Fallbacks are tried in this order: compiled static code, then compiled dynamic
code (NaN-boxed values, shapes, ICs), then this interpreter. Phase 8's vendored QuickJS-NG stays
the other option behind its own gate. T14.0 measures whether it is still needed once this
interpreter runs Test262, and records the answer in plan-notes. The phase is not sequenced after
the Phase 8 gate (§15.1 exception, as Phases 9–13), because the creator directed it.

**What does not change.** `ts` mode is untouched: `eval` stays `STA1101` and `new Function` stays
`STA1103`, permanently. A binary that never reaches the interpreter must not link it: size is
byte-identical to before, and every `ts`-mode binary too (Phase 8's Check, kept). The mode stays
above the gate (§0.8). The frontend marks a construct "interpret", the HIR carries an
`Interpret` node, and the emitter links the package only when such a node exists.

**Why our own interpreter, not only QuickJS-NG.** It runs on the runtime's own `jsrt_value`, so
interpreted and compiled code share objects, shapes and the GC, with no `jsrt_value` ↔ `JSValue`
marshaling layer (the largest item in Phase 8, step 2). It is strict TS, so §0.9 and §0.10 hold and
one toolchain builds it. Its speed is what Stator's `ts`-mode codegen makes of it, so it doubles as
a large benchmark of the compiler.

| Package | Holds | Must not |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `packages/interpreter` (new) | the parser front (T14.1), the evaluator over runtime values, and the entry points the runtime calls (`eval`, `Function` constructor), in **strict TypeScript** compiled by Stator in `ts` mode | hold its own value model, object model or GC — values are `jsrt_value`, objects are runtime objects, memory is the Zig core (§11a) |
| `packages/compiler` | the `Interpret` HIR node, scope materialization for direct `eval`, and linking the package on demand | interpret anything at compile time |
| `packages/runtime` | the C ABI the interpreter calls (property access, calls, allocation, exceptions, promise jobs) — mostly what compiled dynamic code already calls | grow a second dispatch path: the interpreter goes through the same ICs and helpers |

### T14.0. Design: the interpreter — **[D4]**

Docs first (§15.6): `docs/INTERPRETER.md`, settled with a measured spike. The spike `eval`s one
expression and one function body from a compiled `js` program through a minimal evaluator, and
prints what Node prints. Questions it must answer:

1. **The parser, and §0.3.** §0.3 forbids the *compiler* from writing a parser. The interpreter
   needs one at run time for `eval` strings. Options:
   - (a) The `typescript` package's own scanner and parser, compiled into the binary by Stator in
     `js` mode, tree-shaken to `createSourceFile`. This keeps §0.3 literally, but depends on T11.4
     (`tsc` compiles) and Phase 12 (tree-shaking).
   - (b) An existing ECMAScript parser written in TypeScript, vendored, if one builds under the
     locked `tsconfig` and is maintained.
   - (c) A parser written here, which needs a plan-notes entry, and §0.3 is edited if this is the
     choice.

   Measure binary size and parse speed for each option that builds.
2. **Execution model.** Tree-walking over the AST, or compiling to bytecode first. QuickJS uses
   bytecode. Measure both on the spike before choosing.
3. **Direct `eval` and scopes.** A direct `eval` sees its caller's locals. Which compiled functions
   must keep their scope as an environment record (only those that contain a direct `eval`), what
   indirect `eval` sees (global only), and how `var` declarations inside `eval` behave in sloppy
   mode and in strict mode.
4. **Boundary with compiled code.** Calls in both directions, exceptions crossing it (landing pads,
   `JSRT_FRAME` pops — AGENTS.md rooting rules), GC roots held by interpreter frames, and
   `this`/`new.target`/`arguments` inside interpreted functions.
5. **Async and generators.** Interpreted `async`/`await`, generators and `for await` drive the
   same promise/microtask machinery as compiled code (Task 4.6), with no second event loop.
6. **Which `not-yet` codes it takes over.** `STA1206` first. List the other `STA12xx` codes the
   interpreter can serve (e.g. `with`, sloppy-mode-only forms) and which stay with Phase 8 or stay
   `not-yet`. Any new diagnostic codes are allocated in `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md`.
7. **QuickJS-NG after this.** Keep Phase 8 as an alternative behind `--interpreter=stator|quickjs`,
   or retire it. The answer comes from Test262 numbers and binary size, not taste.
8. **Oracle.** Test262 (Task 6.1) run through `eval`, so every test executes in the interpreter,
   plus differential fuzzing against the pinned Node (Task 6.2).

**Check:** `docs/INTERPRETER.md` answers 1–8 with the spike's numbers; plan-notes records the
choices; T14.1–T14.4 are edited to match; `docs/README.md` lists the new doc.

### T14.1. `packages/interpreter`: the parser front — **[D4]**

Depends on T14.0 (§1's choice). Turns source text into the tree T14.2 runs. Early errors are
`SyntaxError`s thrown at run time, the same errors Node throws for the same `eval` string.

**Check:** the Test262 `language/` parse-only tests (negative syntax tests included) pass through
`eval` at a recorded rate; parse speed and the binary-size delta are recorded in plan-notes.

### T14.2. `packages/interpreter`: the core evaluator — **[D5]**

Depends on T14.1. Expressions, statements, functions, closures, objects, arrays, classes,
destructuring, exceptions. Values come from the runtime, and property access goes through the same
ICs and helpers compiled dynamic code uses.

**Check:** the T14.0 §8 Test262 slice runs through `eval` with its pass rate tracked in the
dashboard (Task 6.3) under its own column; golden fixtures for `eval` match Node byte-for-byte.

### T14.3. Wiring: `eval`, `new Function`, and the `Interpret` node — **[D5]**

Depends on T14.2. The frontend gate stops emitting `STA1206` in `js` mode and marks the construct
"interpret". Lowering materializes the scopes of functions that contain a direct `eval` (T14.0 §3).
The emitter links the package only when an `Interpret` node exists. Decision tests flip
`not-yet` → `dynamic` in the same commit (AGENTS.md).

**Check:** a `js` program that mixes compiled modules, a direct `eval` reading a caller's local,
an indirect `eval` and a `new Function` runs exactly as under Node. Binaries without an `Interpret`
node, and every `ts`-mode binary, are byte-identical in size to before. `test:asan` is clean.

### T14.4. Async, generators, and the remaining constructs — **[D4]**

Depends on T14.3. Interpreted `async`/`await`, generators and async iteration on the shared
promise machinery (T14.0 §5), plus every other `STA12xx` code T14.0 §6 assigned to the interpreter.

**Check:** the Test262 slice for these features passes at a recorded rate. Each code taken over
flips its decision tests in the same commit, and `explain` no longer lists it for those
constructs.

## 12. Make it better — the optimization ladder (post-MVP, in this order)

Ordering rule (from the Boa deep-dive): **memory first, codegen last**. Each step: measure on the Phase-6 harness before/after; keep the change only if the geomean moves.

| # | Change | Expected gain (research-sourced) | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | mimalloc/jemalloc as default allocator | 5–15% on heap-heavy code (Boa evidence) | days |
| 2 | Escape analysis → stack allocation; bump/arena allocation for non-escaping object graphs (one of Perry's actual speed sources, with LICM and integer div/mod fast paths) | large on allocation-bound code | 2–4 wk |
| 3 | Replace Boehm with precise generational GC (nursery + tenured; the §2 shadow-frame discipline makes this runtime-only). Evaluate MMTk before writing one. | Boa budgets 350 h for the same move; 50–70% pause reduction, 10–20% throughput | 6–10 wk |
| 4 | Hot/cold field split in object layout; IC hit-rate counters on dynamic-residue paths to find type-check hotspots | 5–10% (Nova-inspired) | 1–2 wk |
| 5 | String ropes for concat-heavy code + small-string inlining | 5–15% on string workloads (V8/JSC precedent) | 3–5 wk |
| 6 | Direct LLVM backend: emit `.ll` text (no bindings needed from TS) on the hot path; LTO + PGO; keep the C emitter as `--emit=c` debug backend | clang already does most of this — measure before believing | 4–8 wk |
| 7 | Startup: snapshot initialized globals/builtins into the binary (V8 snapshot model) | **none available here** — an empty binary already starts in 3.2 ms (measured; see rung 7 below) | not scheduled |
| 8 | WasmGC backend — cross-browser baseline since Safari 18.2 (Dec 2024). Strategic optionality, not perf | new target, not a speedup | months |

**Entry criterion, and why nothing here is a task yet.** No rung starts before Task 6.3's benchmark
harness exists and its perf-regression gate has a **measured** noise floor (6.3 step 7). Every row
above is a claim about a number; without the harness there is no way for one to be wrong, and a
ladder of unfalsifiable claims is a wish list. When a rung is scheduled it becomes a numbered task in
a phase, with Steps and a Check like any other — this table is an ordering, not a backlog.

**Ryū rides here too** (owner's call, 2026-09-04, plan-notes 190, closing note 188's unclaimed
follow-up). §15.4 lists Ryū-exact number printing as settled and `docs/TOOLCHAIN.md` now records it
as fetchable and unfetched; what is NOT settled is when. `shortest_digits()` costs up to 18
`snprintf`+`strtod` pairs per number printed, and note 28 kept the swap contained to that one
function's body — but the corpus it would replace already matches Node byte-for-byte, so this is a
pure speed change with no correctness argument for jumping the entry criterion above. It becomes a
rung with a measured before/after when the harness exists, not a task now.

**The discipline every rung shares:**
- **Baseline, change, re-measure on the same host**, recording version, flags, hardware and the exact
  program (§15.5). Cross-host comparison is not evidence: `tests/bench/baseline.json` is explicitly
  machine-local.
- **Keep only if the geomean moves past the noise floor; otherwise revert** — and write the negative
  result into `plan-notes.md`. An unrecorded non-gain is re-attempted by the next person at full
  price, which is the most expensive kind of missing note.
- **Semantics are not a variable.** Golden suites stay byte-for-byte, ASan/UBSan and `test:leak` stay
  green, and both GC configurations still build. An optimization that changes output is a semantics
  bug wearing a speedup's clothes.
- **Anything that adds a dependency or a build mode is feature-flagged** on the `just runtime-intl` model
  (Task 4.4): its own build directory, its own CI job, default archive unchanged.

**1 — Allocator.** Check the premise before spending the days: Boa's 5–15% is an *object*-allocator
result, and here the object allocator is Boehm. Every collected allocation goes through
`GC_generic_malloc` in `jsrt_gc_alloc` (`runtime/src/jsrt_gc.c`), which mimalloc under `malloc` never
sees. What a swapped allocator does reach is the non-collected sites — regexp capture and key
scratch, shape key encoding, unicode conversion buffers, JSON digit buffers, the `console.count` /
`console.time` tables, Intl — plus the no-Boehm fallback, where `jsrt_gc_alloc` *is* `malloc`.
So profile those sites first; if they are a couple of percent, record it and skip the rung.
Otherwise this lands **after** rung 3, when the collector is ours and its backing allocator is a real
choice. Acquisition is a vendor drop with a `VENDOR.md` pin (plan-notes 188),
never a package fetch — the pin is what makes the version auditable — and never a global `malloc` interposition while Boehm is in
the process: two allocators contending for one symbol is a debugging session, not a benchmark.

**2 — Escape analysis.** The preconditions already hold: allocation sites are visible in HIR (object
and array literals, closures), and the pass belongs in `src/passes/` beside `constfold`/`dce`/
`inline`, with `verifyHir` running after it like every other pass. Conservative by default — an
allocation escapes unless proven otherwise — and three things escape: stores into a global slot,
anything a callee can reach, and anything live on a landing-pad path out of the frame. The trap is
specific to this design: `jsrt_push_roots` masks every frame slot and hands it to Boehm as a heap
address, so a stack-allocated or arena object must **never** occupy a `JSRT_FRAME` slot. Make that an
HIR-verifier check (a stack allocation's uses are all frame-local), not a code-review habit. LICM and
the integer div/mod fast paths named in the row are separate changes — land them separately or the
geomean cannot attribute the win to any of the three.

**3 — Precise GC.** Half of it is already paid for: root enumeration is real and load-bearing
(`jsrt_push_roots` walks the shadow stack), which is what §2's rooting discipline was always for.
What is missing is *heap* precision — `jsrt_mark` masks every word and marks conservatively, with a
documented ceiling of retaining objects it does not own. Precise means a layout descriptor per
collected allocation, which touches every `jsrt_gc_alloc` call site. Two things settle before code:
(a) **MMTk's API is Rust**, and "no Rust anywhere" is settled (§15.4) — evaluating MMTk is fine,
adopting it reopens a settled decision and needs measured evidence in `plan-notes.md`, not a
preference; (b) a **moving** collector invalidates any NaN-boxed reference a C local holds across a
safepoint, so "a reference that crosses an allocation lives in a frame slot" must become an enforced
codegen invariant *before* anything moves. The second win is easy to miss: the no-Boehm build never
collects at all today (justfile: "plain malloc (no collection)"), so this rung is also what
makes `pnpm run test:leak` meaningful on a machine without bdw-gc instead of skipping.

**4 — Hot/cold split and IC counters.** Cheap because both mechanisms exist already
(`runtime/src/jsrt_shape.c`, the emitter's `icSite()`); this is instrumentation, not machinery.
Counters first — hit / miss / megamorphic per site, dumped at exit — and the field split follows what
they say. Splitting layout before the counters exist optimizes the profile you imagined. Counters
live behind the feature-flag rule above, so the default archive keeps its size.

**5 — String ropes.** Codegen is already insulated: `jsrt_value.h` states that generated C touches
string contents only through `jsrt_string_length`/`jsrt_string_char` so exactly this change stays
runtime-only. The cost is inside the runtime, where ~93 direct `->data` uses across six files
(`jsrt_string.c`, `jsrt_string_ops.c`, `jsrt_regexp.c`, `jsrt_print.c`, `jsrt_unicode.c`,
`jsrt_intl.c`) assume a flat buffer — each becomes a flatten call or a rope-aware rewrite, and the
regexp bridge is the one place flattening is not optional (libregexp wants contiguous units).
Small-string inlining is a *different* change with a heavier blast radius: it redefines what a
NaN-boxed payload can hold, so it edits `docs/VALUE.md` and `jsrt_value.h` — the codegen↔runtime
contract — in the same commit. Identity is the correctness trap: `===` on strings is by value, and no
rope may make two equal strings distinguishable. Justification comes from Task 6.3's string-churn
program, not from V8/JSC precedent.

**6 — LLVM backend.** Cheapest rung first, and here that is not LLVM: measure what `-O2` C leaves
behind by building the compute set with `-O3`, `-flto` and PGO through the existing path
(`src/cli/build.ts` passes a single `-O2` today). If LTO+PGO recovers most of the gap, this row is
days of flag work rather than 4–8 weeks and the backend is unnecessary. If it is built, `--emit=c`
stays permanently — it is how a codegen bug gets reported (`--keep-c`) — and the real cost is not
instruction selection but everything clang was doing for free, starting with `#line` maps becoming
`!dbg` metadata.

**7 — Startup snapshot: measured, and not scheduled.** V8 snapshots exist because V8 *constructs* a
builtin object graph at startup. Stator does not: `jsrt_init()` is a 48-bit-pointer probe plus
`GC_INIT()`, builtins are dead-stripped C functions rather than constructed objects, and `main()`
opens a globals frame and runs the program. Measured 2026-09-01 (Apple M3 Max, Darwin 25.6, Apple
clang 21.0.0, `-O2`, Boehm build, Node v26.7.0, best of 15 spawns): empty compiled program
**3.2 ms**, `node` on an empty module **27.0 ms**, `/bin/true` **0.23 ms**. The whole budget a
snapshot could attack is ~3 ms, most of it dynamic linking — the row's "50–200 ms class wins" was
inherited from an architecture Stator does not have (plan-notes 137). The rung goes live only if a
profile shows a startup floor worth attacking, and the lever then is link-time (static linking,
page-in behaviour), not a heap snapshot.

**8 — WasmGC.** The row is honest that it is optionality, not speed; gate it like Phase 8, on a named
user needing a browser target, recorded before work starts. Be equally honest about the size: under
WasmGC the *host* owns objects, so NaN-boxing, Boehm, and the shadow-stack rooting discipline all
stop applying. That is a second backend and a second runtime sharing a frontend — which is why it is
months, and why it is last.

Standing practices:
- **Split emitted C per module and compile in parallel** — today `emitC(module)` returns one string
  and `linkExecutable` makes one `clang -O2` call over it (`src/codegen/index.ts`,
  `src/cli/build.ts`), so a large program is one translation unit on one core. This is also the v0
  incremental-build answer: whole-program HIR, per-module C, `.o` cached by content hash of (C text +
  flags + runtime archive). Measure the trade rather than assuming it — separate TUs lose
  cross-module inlining at `-O2`, which is precisely the hole `-flto` (rung 6) fills.
- **Compiler throughput:** reuse the `ts.Program`/checker across builds (watch mode later); if parsing/checking exceeds the §13 tripwire, move parsing to `oxc-parser` (napi) and keep the checker for types only; re-evaluate tsgo quarterly. Measured first on 2026-09-01: the `typescript` API is 8.5% of a 111,750-line build and shrinking with scale, so this is not where the time goes (plan-notes 134).
- **The HIR verifier's scope copying WAS the front end's ceiling — fixed 2026-09-13.**
`verifyFunction`/`verifyBlock` used to fork the whole enclosing binding map per scope (quadratic:
190 ms at 11k lines, 3.6 s at 45k, **21.5 s at 112k**); `b5da1d1` landed the prescribed
parent-linked scopes, and a 2026-09-14 re-measurement on scope-hostile synthetic inputs reads
≤1 ms at 10.9k/44.9k/112.1k lines (plan-notes 248). `src/cli/build.ts`'s "it costs one tree
walk" is true again. **Second ceiling, same shape one layer up — landed 2026-09-14.**
The lowering's `Scope.child()`/`functionScope()` duplicated the whole visible map per block and
per function (22→33→63 µs/line across the same three sizes); parent-linked scopes now link
instead of copying (`unitDeclared` sharing and the declare same-scope rule preserved), reading
15.8→12.1→11.0 µs/line with the many-tiny/few-big shape gap closed (50.6-vs-3.1 → 3.0-vs-2.9)
and HIR output byte-identical for identical input (plan-notes 249). Check shape, met: synthetic
ms/line flat, golden byte-for-byte, full gate green.
- **Perf-regression gate in CI** (Boa's lesson: conformance work silently taxes performance ~1–2%/release without a gate). The gate is built and shipping at 20%; what is still open under Task 6.3 is the *measured* spread it must sit above, because an alarm that fires on noise costs more than no gate.
- **Publish the conformance % and benchmarks** — the field's trust currency. Task 6.1 steps 6–8 own the number and the honesty rules that travel with it (skips counted by feature, printed beside the percentage).

## 13. Risks (with tripwires)

| Risk | Tripwire | Response |
|---|---|---|
| `typescript` API too slow / memory-heavy on large graphs | checking >30% of compile wall-time, or OOM on a 100k-line graph | Program reuse + caching first; then `oxc-parser` (napi) for parse, checker for types only; re-test tsgo's API each quarter in `plan-notes.md`. **Measured 2026-09-01 — not tripped:** 8.5% of wall and 856 MB peak on a 111,750-line graph, and the share falls as the graph grows (plan-notes 134). Next re-test 2026-12 |
| Subset too small to be useful | Phase-3 exit program needs >3 workarounds | Widen `SUBSET.md` deliberately (one row at a time, with decision tests), never ad hoc in code |
| `js` mode drifts toward full-JS static analysis (the graveyard's mistake) | any `js`-mode feature that needs whole-program abstract interpretation of untyped values | Route it to the dynamic representation or Phase 8 tier — §0.1 is absolute |
| Builtins long tail eats the schedule | Coverage dashboard flat for a month | Cut scope to the niche's actual needs; consider pulling Phase 8 forward for cold builtins |
| Boundary checks dominate runtime | Profiler shows >15% in `jsrt_check_*` | Check-coalescing pass (hoist out of loops); widen compiled types |
| Monomorphization code bloat | Binary >2× budget | Instantiation sharing; boxed `Unknown` fallback instantiation for cold generics (Task 3.4) |
| Own-source strictness fights Node type-stripping | build breaks on `enum`/`namespace`/param properties | They're banned (`erasableSyntaxOnly`) — fix the code, never the config |
| The niche evaporates (a competitor ships it) | Quarterly `NICHE.md` review | Fold effort into contributing to that competitor — the sunk-cost check is explicit |

## 14. Effort summary (effort, not deadlines — see §2)

| Milestone | Scope | Estimate |
|---|---|---|
| Bootstrap + skeleton (Phases 1–2) | hello world, differential harness, CI | 2–4 wk, 1 agent/engineer |
| MVP `ts` mode (Phases 3–4 + fuzzing) | scriptc-scope: CLI tools/workers, ~500-line programs | 4–6 months, 1–2 in parallel (disjoint lowering rungs) |
| `js` mode (Phase 5) | mixed graphs, `var`, dynamic residue everywhere | +4–6 wk |
| Conformance visible (Phase 6) | Test262 dashboard, nightly fuzz, bench page | +3–4 wk, then continuous |
| FFI (Phase 7) | SQLite demo, header gen | +4–6 wk |
| Dynamic tier (Phase 8) | QuickJS-NG fallback | +6–10 wk *if gated in* |
| Zig memory core (Phase 9 / T9.1) | GC glue, alloc helpers, shapes, growable buffers | landed (`done.md` §11a) |
| `std` + threads + parallel compile (Phase 10) | stdlib, OS threads↔async, `STATOR_COMPILE_JOBS` | +4–8 wk (T10.1/T10.3), +6–10 wk (T10.2) |
| `--node` (Phase 11) | typed arrays, `packages/std` + `packages/node`, CommonJS, sync `tsc` (N1) | T11.1–T11.6; the largest item is T11.4 (js-mode coverage, not Node). N2 deferred, N3 not planned (plan-notes 289) |
| Bundler front end (Phase 12) | `statorc/api`, `BundlerAdapter`, `packages/vite-stator`; packages + CommonJS bundled into one vendor module, project stays Stator's graph | T12.0 landed (plan-notes 296, `docs/BUNDLER.md`); T12.1–T12.3 |
| Web API (Phase 13) | `packages/webapi` (DOM + CSS, strict TS, render API) + `packages/renderer-clay` (default renderer) | T13.0 design first; T13.1–T13.5 (coverage in generated `docs/WEBAPI.md`); other Web APIs low priority (plan-notes 298, 299) |
| JS interpreter (Phase 14) | `packages/interpreter` in strict TS: `eval`, `new Function` and other `not-yet` constructs in `js` mode, on the runtime's own values | T14.0 design first; T14.1–T14.4 (plan-notes 300) |
| Optimization ladder §12 rows 1–5 | competitive perf story | +3–5 months |
| Conformance long tail | Porffor is at ~61% Test262 after years with a funded lead | years — the moat, budget honestly |

**Difficulty legend (`[Dn]` tags on open tasks).** The tag answers *how much has to be designed
before anything can be written*, not how many lines it is — which is why a one-line diagnostic swap
that needs a settled semantics decision outranks a large mechanical sweep. It is a sequencing aid,
never a licence to cut a Check (§2's estimates rule applies unchanged).

| Tag | Means | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| **D1** | hours | one file, existing mechanism, or citing evidence that already exists |
| **D2** | ~a day | one mechanism end to end, fixtures included; nothing to decide first |
| **D3** | days | crosses layers (lowering + emitter, or emitter + runtime); new fixtures in both modes |
| **D4** | 1–2 weeks | a new mechanism **plus** a semantics question to settle before code — the answer goes in `docs/` first (§15.6) |
| **D5** | weeks+ | a subsystem, or a family large enough that it lands in sub-parts with their own evidence |

Struck-through work carries no tag — `done.md` is the record. §12's ladder keeps its own **Effort**
column and is not re-tagged: those rows are not tasks until they are scheduled.

## 15. Agent execution protocol

1. Work top-down by phase; within a phase, by task order (steps are ordered by dependency). Do not start a phase before the previous phase's **Check** passes. Phase 0's tag gate requires a human; stop and ask there. **Exception:** Phase 9 / T9.1 and Phase 10 (`std` / threads / parallel compiler) are creator-directed and are not gated on Phase 8.
2. Every claim of "done" cites the Check command output (test run, CI link, benchmark diff). No Check, no done. A Check must also stay re-runnable at any later HEAD: an assertion **about** HEAD (`git describe --exact-match HEAD`, "the working tree is clean", a line number) is a point-in-time observation, not a Check, and it turns finished work into work that reports itself unfinished (plan-notes 135).
3. New facts that contradict this plan (a dependency changed, a measurement disagrees) → append to `plan-notes.md` with evidence; update this plan in the same change. The plan is living, but it changes by edit, not by drift.
4. Decisions already made here are **settled** — re-open only with new measured evidence in `plan-notes.md`: TypeScript-strict implementation using the `typescript` API in-process; C11 runtime with a Zig memory core (C11-only reopened on creator direction, plan-notes 238); emit C; generated code stays C; no Rust anywhere; NaN-boxing + `JSRT_FRAME` rooting; UTF-16 strings; Ryū-exact number printing; `Unknown` as first-class HType; cycle-rejecting ESM-only modules; the feature × mode matrix (`docs/SUBSET.md`); `ts` as default mode; `eval` permanently rejected in `ts` mode; the locked tsconfig.
5. When measuring against Node/Bun/QuickJS/competitors: record version, flags, hardware, and the exact program. Never compare against a number you didn't produce.
6. Ambiguity rule: if a task still leaves you guessing, the gap is a bug in this plan — record it in `plan-notes.md` and resolve it by editing the plan, not by inventing an undocumented convention in code.
7. `tsconfig.json` and the oxlint rules are load-bearing. Never weaken them to make code compile — fix the code, or follow rule 3.
8. Generated C is never hand-edited; fix the emitter. Vendored code (`runtime/vendor/`) is never modified except by documented, minimal patches recorded in `plan-notes.md`.
9. **A `not-yet` diagnostic names the phase that owns its BLOCKER**, never the phase that happens to be open — and when a phase closes, every code naming it is delivered or reassigned in that same change. A not-yet pointing at a finished phase reads as a schedule and is a dead end (plan-notes 112). Two corollaries, both learned the hard way (plan-notes 136): a blocker that is a **build flag** is not a phase at all, so the diagnostic omits `phase` and names the flag; and a **catch-all** takes the phase that owns most of what it refuses, with the named exceptions answered from a table beside it. This rule lived only inside §7 Task 4.7 until 2026-09-01, which is part of why seventy sites survived naming a phase that had been complete for six days. `tests/unit/phases.test.ts` enforces it against `src/support/phases.ts`, which `done.md` pins.

## 16. Verification log

- **v1.0** (2026-08-29): initial plan synthesized from the five research fan-outs.
- **v1.1** (2026-08-29): adversarial review by three independent agents; 24 findings folded in. Highlights: WasmGC ship dates corrected; tsgo/OXC API maturity caveats added; Static Hermes ffigen downgraded to "experimental in-tree script"; unverified Boa/scriptc figures marked reported-not-measured; numeric-semantics contract, GC rooting-before-codegen, exception-cleanup, and module-init-order tasks added as blockers; classes-with-getters and Map-key ambiguities resolved; CLI renamed `ketch` (jsc collides with JavaScriptCore); bootstrap task, sidecar protocol, test-metadata conventions, machine-verifiable Checks specified. One reviewer suggestion **rejected**: rounding float output to 6 decimals in differential tests — that hides real divergences; we match Node's shortest-round-trip formatting exactly instead.
- **v2.0** (2026-08-29, directed pivot by project owner):
  - **Renamed Ketch → Stator** (name collision; stator/rotor mirrors the static/dynamic mode pair). CLI binary `stator`.
  - **Implementation language: Rust → TypeScript (strict).** Consequences: Cargo workspace → npm workspace; the entire tsc *sidecar* (out-of-process JSON protocol, `tools/sidecar/`, `SIDECAR.md`) is **deleted** — the checker is now in-process via the `typescript` API, removing the plan's highest-risk glue; OXC drops out of v0 (kept as a §13 fallback via napi); the runtime moves from Rust-staticlib-with-C-ABI to plain **C11** (same NaN-boxing, rooting, Boehm, libregexp design — unchanged conceptually).
  - **Two-mode product spec added (§1):** strict `ts` mode (TS-only; `any` and dynamic escape hatches are errors — `eval` permanently) and `js` mode (JS and JS+TS mixed; untyped = dynamic, never rejected). `SUBSET.md` upgraded from a 3-way column to a feature × mode matrix; diagnostics got stable `STA` codes with disjoint never/not-yet ranges; `stator explain --json` added so decision tests are machine-verifiable.
  - **`js` mode inserted as Phase 5**; old Phases 5/6/7 renumbered to 6/7/8; Test262 explicitly bound to `js` mode.
  - Every phase expanded to numbered per-task **Steps** executable by any AI agent; `AGENTS.md` (operational handbook) introduced at repo root; spec docs consolidated under `docs/`.
- **v2.1** (2026-08-29): **Phase 1 marked ✅ COMPLETE** after re-verifying its Checks with a clean `./ci.sh` run (subset runner: `152 fixtures — 0 passed, 152 expected-fail, 0 failed` — the correct pre-Phase-2 state). The executed step lists and the 26-row seed matrix were removed from §4: `docs/SUBSET.md` (76 rows) and `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md` are the row/code authorities, and the deviations live in `plan-notes.md` entries 1–19 (incl. the ESLint→Biome swap, #19). **Phase 0 remains open** — no `NICHE.md` or `phase-0-approved` tag; it was bypassed for Phase 1 on explicit owner instruction and still gates Phase 2 per §15.1. The Phase 1/3 implementation snapshots are now committed. Also open: the Node 26.7.0-vs-LTS pin question (notes #9).
- **v2.2** (2026-09-01): **the log resumes** — it had stopped at v2.1 while Phases 2, 3 and 4 were built, so the plan's own change history was silent for the largest stretch of work in the project. Recorded now, from `plan-notes.md` and the phase Check lines: **Phase 2 ✅ COMPLETE** (2026-08-29, walking skeleton end to end); **Phase 3 ✅ COMPLETE** (2026-08-30, all twelve tasks and eight ladder rungs; the phase exit ran a 477-line five-module transit route planner byte-for-byte against Node); **Phase 4 in progress** — 4.1, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 landed and 4.6 landed its async half, with 4.2 (builtins) open at 131/197 dashboard members.
- **v2.3** (2026-09-01): **`plan.md` split** — completion records moved to `done.md`, leaving this file at open work only (761 → ~420 lines). Section numbers and every task's number and title are unchanged so the ~60 `plan.md §N Task X.Y` references in `docs/`, `src/`, `runtime/src/` and `tests/` still resolve (plan-notes 115). **Phase 4 gained an explicit exit criterion**, which it had never had — it had a Check but no scope boundary, which is why four not-yet codes named it as their deliverer while it was closing. The residue is now assigned by blocker: `Date` to Task 4.2 (which had never actually named it), `RegExp`'s `exec`/`match` to Phase 4's own array-with-properties work, `matchAll` and the iterator surface to Phase 5 step 8, top-level `await` to step 9, dynamic `import()` to step 10, the descriptor/prototype surface to Phase 8. Phase 5 is retitled to admit that steps 8–11 are not `js`-mode work. New **Task 4.7** audits the 58 gate call sites that hardcode phase 4, and §15 gains the rule that a not-yet code names the phase owning its **blocker**, never the phase that happens to be open (plan-notes 116).
- **v2.4** (2026-09-01): Re-reviewed the Phase-4 implementation and roadmap. The completed Task 4.3–4.6 records were already preserved in `done.md`; their duplicate narratives were replaced here by required one-line stubs. Task 4.1 remains open for the array-with-properties blocker, and Task 4.2 remains open at the live dashboard's 131/197 surface members (plan-notes 118).
- **v2.5** (2026-09-01): **the two open tasks gained numbered Steps** (plan-notes 127), backed by a five-agent evidence audit of the repo and the pinned Node v26.7.0. Task 4.2's remainder is now two step lists — `Date` (sliced by what makes each member deterministic: a TZ-independent core, a local-time slice behind a golden-runner `TZ=UTC` pin, an intl-build residue for the ICU-named `toString`/`toLocale*` family, and the carve-out pair; ISO-only `Date.parse` recorded as a documented divergence) and `console.table` + the `time`/`timeEnd`/`trace` carve-out trio. Task 4.7 gained Steps and its own Check; its site count was corrected from 58 to the audited **63** (60 `STA1214` + 2 `STA1211` + 1 `STA1215` at `39cf053`), with the audit's grouping (2 pure-5.8, 2 pure-5.11, 8 straddling catch-alls, 51 unowned) folded into the steps. The exit-criterion `Date` bullet was rewritten per-member per the plan-notes-125 rule.
- **v2.6** (2026-09-01): **reconciliation after a same-day race** (plan-notes 130). The `console.table` + carve-out-trio step list added in v2.5 was overtaken by a parallel session that landed the work (`0ef7724`; carve-out proof `tests/unit/console-carveout.test.ts`) while the steps were being adversarially verified — the list is replaced by a landed record, leaving `Date` as Task 4.2's only remaining builtin. The race also produced the second plan-notes numbering collision (see note 115): two same-day entries each took 126 and 127; the later pair is renumbered 128/129 and the one inbound reference fixed. The verification pass on v2.5's own text resolved three challenges: the 63-site count STANDS (the challengers' single-line greps miss multi-line `notYet(` calls — a multiline-aware recount of the current tree finds 61 + 2 + 1 = 64, moved by the console slices exactly as Task 4.7 step 1 predicts), the Promise call-side phase-5 claim stands, and one bad reference (plan-notes 117, which does not exist — the console plumbing note is 94) went away with the replaced step list.
- **v2.7** (2026-09-01): **every remaining phase gained numbered Steps** (plan-notes 131) — Phase 5's eleven steps, Phase 6's three tasks, Phase 7's three tasks plus a phase preamble and an explicit v0 out-of-scope table, and Phase 8's nine. Written against the live tree rather than from the task lines, which changed several of them: Phase 5 step 1's substrate (`allowJs`/`checkJs` by mode, HIR `provenance`, `explain`'s per-function print) is already landed, so the step is now the `inferred` grade alone; step 5's boundary-trap proof cannot be a Node-diff golden, because Node runs a lying-JSDoc program happily — it needs an expected-stderr harness mode; step 11's mechanism is not a new one but a subsection of `docs/VALUE.md` §4.9's existing pending-cell protocol — a runtime-side call that checks `jsrt_pending()` and hands the builtin a completion value, which is precisely the gap `STA1216`'s row already names — and it carries an unlock sweep (`Object.freeze`/`isFrozen`, `toISOString` on an Invalid Date, every `SUBSET.md` row that reads "the spec throws, which builtins cannot raise yet"). Phase 6 is framed by its one failure mode — a green signal that proves less than it appears to — so Test262 skips are mapped from `SUBSET.md` rows with an unmapped feature tag a hard error, the corpus is fetched rather than vendored (~50k files, and no network here — plan-notes 28) with a missing corpus SKIPPING so `pnpm run ci` stays offline-runnable, the fuzzer is type-directed and seeded (no clock, no `Math.random`) so a finding replays from `--seed=N`, and Task 6.3 extends the existing `tests/bench/record.ts` instead of replacing it. Phase 7 gained the four things that make FFI four weeks instead of one line (memory, UTF-16 strings, C error codes, direction asymmetry), a concrete ABI table, and the two questions nobody can leave implicit: which side owns a pointer after a call, and what a C caller sees when TS throws. Phase 8's first two steps are not implementation — the human gate's evidence, then the marshaling design doc — and its vendoring step must match the `v0.16.2` commit `runtime/vendor/quickjs-ng/VENDOR.md` already pins, since the interpreter ships its own `libregexp` and a second copy is duplicate symbols at link time.
- **v2.8** (2026-09-01): **Phase 0's Check restated so it can pass more than once** (plan-notes 135). The gate itself is unchanged — `NICHE.md` was approved by the owner on 2026-09-01 and its commit is tagged `phase-0-approved`, which supersedes v2.1's "Phase 0 remains open" above — but the Check was written as `git describe --tags --exact-match HEAD`, which asks whether HEAD *is* the approval commit and therefore answered `fatal: no tag exactly matches` from the next commit onward: a closed gate reporting itself open at every later HEAD, in the one section §15.1 makes every phase point at. It now asserts the durable fact (`git cat-file -e phase-0-approved:NICHE.md`, with the added-in-that-commit form as the stronger check), and §15 rule 2 gained the general form — a Check must stay re-runnable at any later HEAD, because an assertion *about* HEAD is a point-in-time observation, not a Check.
- **v2.9** (2026-09-01): **the not-yet audit's own inventory was audited, and it was 2.6× short** (plan-notes 136). Task 4.7's step 1 says to re-derive the site list at execution HEAD; parsing `gate.ts` with the `typescript` API instead of grepping it finds **165** `notYet`/`dateNotYet` sites, not 63 — and 70 of them name **Phase 3, complete since 2026-08-30**, so `rest parameters are not yet supported; planned for Phase 3` is what the compiler prints today. The audit missed them because it asked "which sites name phase 4?" — a question about the phase that happened to be open — while the rule the task itself establishes implies the general one, "does any site name a completed phase?". Task 4.7's inventory paragraph is replaced by the parsed table, step 1 now carries the general question, and step 6 gains two groups (the 70-site ladder residue; the 10 `dateNotYet` sites, whose blocker is the intl feature BUILD and so is step 3's `STA1215` question again, not a phase). §8 Phase 5 gains **step 12**, which owns the residue — six construct families in landing order with their own Check — because it is `ts`-mode static surface §1.1 promises will compile and no phase owned it; deliberately not a new phase, since §15.3 forbids the renumbering that would break `plan.md §N` citations. Phase 5's title gained "3 and", and its bucket warning — previously a feeling — became a named split trigger.
- **v3.0** (2026-09-01): **Phase 4 closed.** Task 4.7 was its last open task, and closing it is what made the phase closable honestly -- 165 not-yet sites re-derived, every one now naming the phase that owns its blocker, and `tests/unit/phases.test.ts` failing the build if that stops being true. §7 compresses to a completed-phase stub on §6's model (task numbers and titles stay, so `§7 Task 4.N` citations resolve); `done.md` gains the exit criterion answered bullet by bullet with the dashboard beside it, and its Phase 4 heading now reads ✅ COMPLETE, which `src/support/phases.ts` mirrors in the same change because the test pins the two together. Three of the five exit bullets sit below 100% on the dashboard and the phase still exits: the dashboard counts MEMBERS, not blockers, and every residue names an owner (plan-notes 125). Phase 5 is now the open phase.
- **v3.1** (2026-09-01): **Phase 5 step 1 was already landed, and its own wording was the thing that needed fixing** (plan-notes 140). The `inferred` grade shipped in `5e9f2b4` the day before v2.7 wrote it up as remaining; what was actually missing was the `explain --json` test, now in `tests/unit/cli.test.ts` and proved able to fail. The step's spec half was worse than stale: it graded a fully JSDoc'd `.js` function `inferred` while the tree grades it `typed`, and step 5 was about to key boundary insertion on a field whose two readings put the trust axis in OPPOSITE directions. A measurement settled it — `checkJs` plus `program.ts`'s fatal `STA0012` means a lying JSDoc is a compile error, not a runtime trap, so what needs checking is a dynamic argument reaching an annotated signature, which is a property of the EDGE and not of any per-function grade. Steps 1, 5 and 6 edited accordingly; `docs/MODES.md` §4 Example 1 (which asserted a runtime check for a call `tsc` rejects statically) and `docs/HIR.md`'s undocumented `provenance` field fixed in the same change.
- **v3.2** (2026-09-02): **Phase 5 step 2 landed** — the diagnostic table now switches by mode (plan-notes 141). Three things that looked implemented were dead: `STA1002` never fired because `allowJs` was ts-off and tsc dropped the `.js` file as `STA0012`; the eval check required `getSymbolAtLocation === undefined` and eval has a lib symbol, so the global catch-all swallowed it as `STA1214`; `1 as any` fired `STA1003` on the binding first. `STA1206` is now emitted. Indirect eval `(0, eval)("x")` is still the arbitrary-callee not-yet.
- **v3.3** (2026-09-02): **Phase 5 step 3 landed** — `var` in js mode is function-scoped, hoisted, initialized `undefined` (plan-notes 142). ts mode stays `STA1104` never. HIR has no `var` kind: the lowering hoists a `let` and assigns at the original site.
- **v3.4** (2026-09-02): **Phase 5 step 4 landed** — Unknown/empty-`{}` property get/set/index/call, `STA2006`, STA2004 grow-only, STA4058 retired (plan-notes 143).
- **v3.5** (2026-09-02): **Phase 5 step 5 landed** — mixed-graph boundary checks at declaration/assignment/call/return edges (plan-notes 144). Trap is an untyped `.js` identity into a `.ts` `number` slot (`STA2001`); a function whose body checkJs types as `string` is `STA0012` and never reaches runtime. Happy path `tests/golden/js/mixed_graph/`.
- **v3.6** (2026-09-02): **Phase 5 step 6 landed** — a fully JSDoc'd `.js` module has file verdict `static` with provenance `typed`; `tests/golden/js/jsdoc_static.js` matches Node.
- **v3.7** (2026-09-02): **Phase 5 step 7 landed** — js-column honesty sweep of already-landed operators/statements plus `tests/golden/js/capstone.js`; `hTypeAssignable` recurses into arrays so `var xs = []` verifies (plan-notes 146).
- **v3.10** (2026-09-05): **§8 step 2a(c)'s first clause landed — `Cannot find name`, the largest
  bucket left (1345 Test262 lines).** Reading an undeclared name now throws a catchable
  `ReferenceError` with Node's wording and a working `instanceof`; `typeof` answers `"undefined"`
  without throwing, answered on the operator where §13.5.1.1 puts it. Two premises in this plan were
  corrected by the work: the gate needed no change (its global branch is guarded by
  `symbol !== undefined`, so the symbol-less identifier already reached the lowering, which was the
  thing manufacturing `STA4035`), and the suppression turned three WRITE forms into `STA4034` until
  the TS2403 rule was asked of 24 syntactic positions at once rather than one fixture. A pre-existing
  `STA4035` on `missing.a = 1` was uncovered, proved pre-existing (TypeScript auto-declares a JS
  global from a property assignment, so the checker never refused it), and left open rather than
  folded in. New: `ReferenceErrorRead`, `jsrt_reference_error`, STA4096. Evidence: plan-notes 197,
  `done.md` → Phase 5 step 2a(c), `pnpm run ci` green (378 unit tests; `subset: 354 fixtures — 325
  passed, 29 expected-fail, 0 failed`; `golden: 160 fixtures — 160 passed`; the same 160 under
  ASan/UBSan).
- **v3.9** (2026-09-05): **§8 step 2a(b) swept to completion and step 2a(c)'s Error model landed.**
  The (b) sweep judged every remaining `STA0012` bucket individually and landed four codes (18050,
  2403, 2695, 8024/8029), judging the strict-mode family a real refusal Stator keeps; 2403 produced
  the sweep's general rule by breaking it — **a suppression is finished only when the program it
  admits COMPILES**, since suppressing it alone turned `STA0012` into `STA4004`. Step 2a(c) then
  landed the Error object model with no new mechanism (five `JSRTClass` descriptors, `name`/`message`
  as ordinary slots, nothing in `jsrt_shape.c` changed, STA4095 pinning the shared layout) and
  removed a wrong answer: `e instanceof Error` had compiled and silently answered false. A 655-test
  Test262 slice (plan-notes 196) then checked the 2403 rule at scale — 115 remaining failures, all
  `STA0012`, **no `STA4xxx`** — and forced two honesty edits: 2704 landed only as a reclassification
  (`STA1214`, the `delete` operator has no lowering), and 2790 was a bucket the sweep had missed.
  `ratchet.json` was neither consulted nor moved: the slice is not the corpus. Evidence: plan-notes
  194–196, `done.md` → Phase 5 step 2a and 2a(c), `pnpm run ci` green (`subset: 352 fixtures — 323
  passed, 29 expected-fail, 0 failed`; `golden: 158 fixtures — 158 passed`; ASan/UBSan golden 158/158).
- **v3.8** (2026-09-04): **§8's landed steps archived** (golden rule 1). Steps 1–11's evidence narratives moved to `done.md` → Phase 5, leaving struck-through stubs that keep every number and title so `§8 step N` citations resolve; step 2a(a) and step 12(c)'s landed halves got the `done.md` sections they had never been given, and step 2a(b)'s bucket list now strikes the four codes that landed (2554/2322/2345/2362-2363) instead of narrating each in place. §8 shrank 1050 → 1000 lines and now states its open surface in one line: **step 2a(b) and step 12(c)–(f)**. The log itself had stopped at v3.7 (2026-09-02) while steps 8–12b, 2a, Task 6.1 and the fuzzer landed on 09-03 — those are recorded in `plan-notes.md` 147–186 and `done.md`, and this entry is the note that they never reached this list rather than a retroactive reconstruction of them.
- **v3.9** (2026-09-04): **the no-network constraint is retired** (plan-notes 188). A `fetch` of `quickjs.h` at the exact commit `runtime/vendor/quickjs-ng/VENDOR.md` pins returns HTTP 200 / 66,272 bytes, and Task 6.1 has been fetching the Test262 corpus over the same transport since 2026-09-03 — the constraint was falsified by work already in the tree. §11 step 3's acquisition clause had also contradicted itself (it forbade the network, then pointed at `runtime/vendor/update.mjs`, which fetches over HTTPS); it now names the script and the one real constraint, the SAME commit as the vendored `libregexp`. §12 rung 1 keeps the `VENDOR.md` pin rule without the reachability reason, and `docs/TOOLCHAIN.md` restates Ryū as fetchable-and-unfetched. **Phase 8's gate is untouched:** step 1's owner record still does not exist, and network availability removes an implementation obstacle from step 3, not the gate.
- **v3.10** (2026-09-04): **the spawn-heavy suites are parallel, and `ink` no longer loads on every spawn** (plan-notes 189). Task 6.1's process pool was lifted out of `tests/test262/run.ts` into `tests/support/parallel.ts` and reused by the subset and golden runners, which were still `spawnSync` in a `for` loop — extraction rather than a third copy, net **−19 lines**, `dupes` steady at 0.9%. Results stay indexed by item so a pooled run's failure list is diffable against a serial one's, and `STATOR_TEST_JOBS=1` restores the serial order without a stash. Separately, plan-notes 187 estimated the ink/react import at "tens of ms"; it measures **~1.6 s** and was paid at module scope by every process, including the `explain --json` and successful-`build` paths that never render — moving it inside `print` cut per-spawn cost **2349 ms → 843 ms**, and forced the `print`/`build`/`explain`/`run` async cascade plus `withSpanAsync` in `src/support/telemetry.ts` (the sync form ends a span the moment an async fn returns a pending promise). Measured uncontended at 16-way parallelism, both columns carrying the ink fix: **`test:subset` 109.7 s → 17.4 s (6.3×)**, **`test:golden` 151.0 s → 44.5 s (3.4×)**. No dependency added — `node:child_process` and `availableParallelism()`. Byte-exactness held: golden **147/147** on stdout *and* stderr.
- **v4.0** (2026-09-04): **the plan's six unmade decisions are made** (plan-notes 190). Every one was a sentence in this file telling the reader to decide something before proceeding, and none of them had been answered — two of them gating the phase that is open right now. Settled: the **Node pin stays 26.7.0** (notes #9, unresolved since 2026-08-29 and marked "settle it before Phase 6's fuzzing leans on it", which is the next task); **accessors** get a get/set pair on a shape entry, `docs/VALUE.md` §4.15 — following `docs/SUBSET.md`'s existing `dynamic` verdict for the row rather than inventing a competing one, so `JSRTClass` gains nothing — unblocking §8 step 12(c)/(d); **method values** need no bound closure at all, §4.16 — `const f = o.m` does not bind in JavaScript, so the method's own `JSRTClosure` is the answer and the second closure representation step 12(e) was told to expect is reserved for `Function.prototype.bind` — unblocking step 12(e); **CI does not commit benchmark results to `main`** (Task 6.3 step 6); **Ryū rides §12** rather than becoming a task (note 188's unclaimed follow-up); and **the computed specifier of `import()` is confirmed Phase 8's** (§11 step 7's "only if owner-confirmed" pointed at a confirmation nobody had recorded). No code changed: this is §15.6 applied to the plan's own backlog of deferred judgment.
- **v4.1** (2026-09-04): **plan-notes 187's written-down remaining work verified, and two green-signal hazards found and planned (plan-notes 191).** The uncommitted 187 tree ran its remaining suites under the pinned Node: unit **367/367** (telemetry 3/3), subset **342 — 311 passed / 31 expected-fail / 0 failed**, golden **147/147** (also under ASan/UBSan), coverage 90.04%, dupes 0.9%, leak plateau 3024 KB. First hazard: the host shell resolves bare `node` to mise's `node/lts` (24.20.0) ahead of the shims while the pin is 26.7.0 — the golden runner diffs against `process.execPath`, so pre-fix "green" runs used the wrong oracle, and `--test-coverage-include-all` exits 9 under 24. 187's "mise trust gap" misattributed it; the PATH order is the mechanism. New **Task 6.2a** fails CI fast when bare `node` is off-pin. Second hazard: the builtins dashboard drifted RED — `Promise.prototype.then/catch/finally` and `Object.freeze`/`isFrozen` landed with step 11 (`b8a0ac8`) but `builtins_coverage.json` still claims `[]`, so `test:builtins` reports `Promise.prototype: 0/3 (0%)` while golden proves all three; the dashboard checks stale-green claims but has no red-direction check. §8 gains **step-12 bookkeeping debt**: cite the landed fixtures, write the js-column freeze twin, and add a unit check cross-referencing the table against the runtime's exported `jsrt_<ns>_<member>` symbols so implemented-but-unclaimed members fail the build. Neither was fixed in place — the session's instruction was to plan them and stop.
- **v4.2** (2026-09-05): **§8 step 2a(c)'s remaining residue narrowed to what is really left.** Two
  landings, both archived in `done.md` → Phase 5 step 2a(c): `missing.a = 1` / `missing[0] = 1` no
  longer raise `STA4035` (plan-notes 199 — a TS-inferred expando namespace is not a runtime
  binding, one lowering predicate shared by reads, writes, `typeof` and receiver typing), and the
  "panic-to-throw" Check landed for the sites that actually were panics (plan-notes 200 — nullish
  and primitive property access and the iterator/generator receiver casts now throw Node's
  `TypeError`; a JS function whose `@returns {Generator}` lied had SIGSEGVed in `for-of`). That
  work corrected note 195's premise: **2454 is definite assignment, not TDZ**, and there is no
  runtime TDZ check to convert; 2488 needs runtime `GetIterator` dispatch, not a throw. Both stay
  open with the corrected reasons, as does the `delete`-operator Check. Emitter side effect: every
  dynamic property/index read, read-modify-write, and `Object` static call now roots its result and
  checks pending, and `Object.assign`, `JSON.stringify` and `console.table` snapshot keys rather
  than entries so getter/setter ordering matches Node. Evidence: `pnpm run ci` green (383 unit tests; `subset: 356 fixtures — 327 passed,
  29 expected-fail, 0 failed`; `golden: 163 fixtures — 163 passed`; the same 163 under ASan/UBSan).
- **v4.3** (2026-09-07): **the panic-to-throw conversion reached the string-length builtins**
  (plan-notes 203). `String.prototype.repeat` with a negative or infinite count, and any
  `repeat`/`padStart`/`padEnd` whose result exceeds the 2^31−1 length cap, threw `STA2005` (a loud
  abort) because the panics predated the throw protocol; they now raise a catchable `RangeError`
  matching Node byte-for-byte — message and all (`Invalid count value: <original arg>`, `Invalid
  string length`). The op table gained a `throws` flag and a `stringOpCanThrow` predicate so the
  emitter emits each as a checked statement with a pending check to the landing pad, the same
  discipline callbacks already follow. `STA2005`'s remaining string clause is `normalize` with a bad
  form; DIAGNOSTICS.md and SUBSET.md updated to match. Evidence: `pnpm run ci` green (subset `356 —
  327 passed, 29 expected-fail, 0 failed`; golden `165 — 165 passed`, the same 165 under ASan/UBSan;
  leak plateau 3040 KB; String.prototype 32/32). New goldens: `tests/golden/{js,ts}/string_range_error`.
- **v4.4** (2026-09-09): **Phase 6's built tasks archived — the plan had described finished work as
  unstarted** (plan-notes 207). Tasks **6.2** (differential fuzzing) and **6.3** (benchmark harness)
  landed on 2026-09-02 (`c2e621b`) and were hardened on 2026-09-03 (`78a5bf3`, with plan-notes
  177–179 writing them up), yet §9 still carried both as open records with their full step lists —
  step 6.2.1 literally instructing an agent to create a directory that had existed for a week —
  and `done.md` had no record of either. Both are now struck stubs pointing at `done.md`, keeping
  only what stays **normative**: the generator-bug rule, the never-normalize rule, and
  divergence-becomes-a-fixture for 6.2; the no-competitor-figures and no-CI-commits rules for 6.3.
  Re-verified before archiving, on the pinned Node at `4956428`: `differential --count=12` → 24
  cases, 0 divergences; `bench:record` → 5 programs, page generated (stator 22.36 ms · node 59.29 ·
  bun 20.00 · four engines absent). Doing 6.3 step 7's own measurement produced the one **residue
  left open with its own Check**: the regression gate ships at 20% against a spread measured once on
  one host (4.0% between two recordings of the same commit), which is above the only noise anyone
  has measured but not above a known floor. **Phase 6 stays open** — its Check's fuzzing clause
  passes on a nightly run's own output, and the scheduled job plus a local run is not that. Also
  recorded rather than fixed: §16 has duplicate `v3.9`/`v3.10` entries from parallel sessions
  appending at once (nothing outside this file cites a log version).

- **v4.5** (2026-09-09): **§8 step 12(e)'s receiver-free half landed, and the family's "settled"
  representation turned out to be settled for one case only** (plan-notes 210, 209). Calling an
  arbitrary expression and function declarations inside a block/loop/branch are struck; their
  evidence is in [done.md](done.md) → Phase 5 step 12e. The first was a gate refusal with nothing
  behind it — HIR, verifier and emitter were already general. The second needed the emitter to
  initialise a hoisted binding when its BLOCK is entered rather than when the enclosing body is,
  plus all three layers agreeing that a `switch`'s clause list is one scope. Implementing against
  `docs/VALUE.md` §4.16 is what found the hole in it: a method value is the method's own closure
  only for a **zero-argument** call, because `jsrt_arg` fills missing arguments from the right and
  the receiver is on the left — `const g = o.add; g(1, 2)` binds `this = 1, a = 2, b = undefined`
  where Node gives `this = undefined, a = 1, b = 2`, and the closure's arity counts the receiver
  (both measured). §4.16 carries the correction; step 12(e) now names it as the blocker for method
  values and calling a class field instead of "a bound closure nothing here builds", which was never
  the obstacle. §8 also gains **step 14**: block scoping is not modelled at all — a shadowed block
  binding shares the enclosing slot, so `const x = 1; { const x = 2; }` reads the outer `x` back as
  2. That is older than this phase and independent of step 12, so it is a step like 13 rather than
  residue; the nested-declaration landing ships with a narrow refusal for exactly the shadowing case
  so it adds no new silent miscompile, and step 14 removes both together.

- **v4.7** (2026-09-13): **Phase 10 card — `std`, threads↔async, parallel host compiler** (plan-notes 240). Creator-directed, not gated on Phase 8. `std` is a systems-style first-party library (docs-first), not a Node polyfill. Threads are shared-heap OS threads with a promise completion bridge onto Task 4.6's microtask queue; SAB/Atomics/Worker stay out of v0. "Rewrite the compiler with threads" means `STATOR_COMPILE_JOBS` + parallel clang/emit/lower on the existing TypeScript host — not a new compiler language. Phase 7's single-threaded FFI caveat now points here.

- **v4.6** (2026-09-13): **Phase 9 / T9.1 is now a main-tree card** (plan-notes 238, 239). The runtime is C11 with a Zig memory core — C11-only reopened on the creator's direction, not measured evidence. Generated code stays C; Rust stays forbidden. The language & library survey (239) is the standing boundary so agents do not invent a second compiler language, MMTk/Rust, or Zig past the memory core. Implementation remains in `.worktrees/t9-1` until a follow-up PR; this revision is plan/docs/notes plus the mise Zig 0.16.0 pin.

- **v4.8** (2026-09-14): **test-speed cards.** §9 gains Tasks 6.4–6.7 (plain-`test` gate, oracle pin, in-process runners, parallel `cli.test.ts`) plus the standing decision that Bun is not a test runner — all from the 241 measurements. 6.4 executes immediately; 6.5→6.6→6.7 in dependency order.
- **v4.9** (2026-10-02): **Phase 11 card — `--node`, research-gated** (plan-notes 286). Creator-directed. A mode that admits CommonJS `require`, `process`, `Buffer`, timers and `node:*` modules, so real Node programs compile; the first target is TypeScript 6.0.3's `tsc` bundle. Only T11.0 (research) is open. §0's npm non-goal, `STA1110` (never) and §11b A (no Node polyfills) stand until its go / no-go is approved.
- **v4.10** (2026-10-02): **Phase 11 decided** (plan-notes 288, 289). T11.0 landed; `--node` is a platform flag over two layers — typed `std/*` backed by Zig, `node:*` in strict TS from scratch — decomposed by package (`runtime` typed arrays, new `packages/std`, new `packages/node`, `compiler` flag + CommonJS). Cards T11.1–T11.6; N2 deferred, N3 not planned. Creator rules: Zig for memory/cross-platform runtime code (§0.5), no JavaScript in our source (§0.10, Task 6.15), any new clone fails `dupes` (Task 6.16), `docs/NODE.md` generated and checked in `ci`.
- **v4.11** (2026-10-02): **Phase 12 card — `js` mode builds through a bundler** (plan-notes 290). Creator-directed: one tree-shaken file per build, any bundler through `statorc/api` + `BundlerAdapter`, `packages/vite-stator` as the default. `ts` mode is untouched. T12.0 (design, docs-first) gates T12.1–T12.2 and may re-scope T11.5's CommonJS work.
- **v4.12** (2026-10-02): **`explain` reports every deciding diagnostic** (plan-notes 291). §1's "per top-level construct" promise was never what shipped; the tree reports a file verdict plus per-function rows. `explain` now also lists every diagnostic of the deciding stage, which is what T11.4's Check needs to count `STA1214`; §1, `docs/MODES.md` §6 and T11.4/T11.5 rewritten to match, including how `--node` will surface platform gaps.
- **v4.14** (2026-10-02): **Phase 13 — Web API with a pluggable render API** (plan-notes 298). New §11e: `packages/webapi` holds DOM + CSS in strict TS and owns the `Renderer` interface; `packages/renderer-clay` is the default renderer (vendored `clay.h` v0.14, Zig glue, TS adapter over FFI). Cards T13.0 (design, `docs/WEBAPI.md`), T13.1 DOM, T13.2 CSS, T13.3 render API + recording renderer, T13.4 Clay renderer; other Web APIs low priority, no cards yet.
- **v4.15** (2026-10-02): **Web API coverage is a generated doc, like `docs/NODE.md`** (plan-notes 299). New card T13.5: `docs/WEBAPI.md` is the coverage table (denominator from the pinned `typescript`'s `lib.dom.d.ts`, claims in `webapi_coverage.json`, stale check in `ci`); T13.0's design doc moves to `docs/WEBAPI-DESIGN.md`; T13.1 depends on T13.5.
- **v4.16** (2026-10-02): **T12.0 landed — the bundler contract** (plan-notes 296, `docs/BUNDLER.md`).

  - **Design.** Measured on Vite 8.3.1 / Rolldown 1.2.12: `js` mode bundles the
    dependencies, not the project. Package imports and CommonJS files go into one vendor ESM
    module. Project `.ts`/`.js` stay in Stator's graph, which keeps static verdicts, boundary
    checks and every golden.
  - **Re-scopes.** T12.1–T12.2 were rewritten, and a new T12.3 compiles Rolldown's output.
    T11.5 drops its CommonJS lowering, because the bundler converts CJS.
  - **Diagnostics.** `STA0014`/`STA0015` are allocated as planned codes.
  - **Creator's answers (BUNDLER.md §9).**
    - "One file" means the dependencies.
    - `__filename`/`__dirname` are not-yet until `--node`, with no baked paths.
    - The order deviation is documented only.
- **v4.17** (2026-10-02): **Phase 14: a JavaScript interpreter in strict TypeScript, `js` mode's second fallback** (plan-notes 300). New §11f: `packages/interpreter`, compiled by Stator, runs `eval`, `new Function` and the `not-yet` constructs it takes over, directly on `jsrt_value` (no marshaling layer). Order: compiled static, then compiled dynamic, then the interpreter. Phase 8's QuickJS-NG stays as an option behind its gate until T14.0 measures whether it is still needed. Cards T14.0 (design, `docs/INTERPRETER.md`, including §0.3's parser question), T14.1 parser front, T14.2 evaluator, T14.3 wiring, T14.4 async and the rest. `ts` mode is unchanged.
- **v4.18** (2026-10-02): **T11.2 lands: `packages/std` is the real `std/*` package** (plan-notes 294). `std/env`, `std/path`, `std/process`, sync `std/fs` and `std/time` resolve through `paths` and link `libjsrt_std.a` only into programs that import them; unknown `std/foo` is the new `STA3002`. T10.1 steps 2–4 are struck (step 5 stays open); §11b's v0 table moves `std/env.args` to T11.3 as `std/process.argv`; T11.3's `std/fs` row drops `unlink`, `rmdir` and text reads. Record in `done.md`.
- **v4.19** (2026-10-02): **Task 6.18 — `stator.config.json`** (plan-notes 303). Every CLI option can come from a JSON config validated against a generated JSON Schema, or from the command line, or both. `--config`/`--no-config` pick the file and never appear in it. Precedence: CLI > env > file > default.
- **v4.20** (2026-10-02): **T11.5a — per-module namespaces before T11.6** (plan-notes 302). Each module gets its own top-level namespace (module-qualified C names), and every aliasing shape lands: renamed, default and `* as ns` imports, renamed and default exports, `export … from`, `export *`. This removes the one-namespace `STA1214` collisions that T11.2 found (plan-notes 294). T11.6 depends on it; T12.1 step 3 shares `export { a as b }` with it.
- **v4.21** (2026-10-02): **Task 6.19 — self-compilation test** (plan-notes 304). Stator compiles itself and its own packages (`std`, later `node`, `webapi`, `renderer-clay`, `interpreter`) as a ratcheted test. Per-target diagnostic counts may only shrink. A target at zero builds and runs its smoke check, and for the compiler that check is a byte-identical stage-2 bootstrap. Baseline: compiler 2 522 `STA1214` in `ts` mode; `std` already compiles.
- **v4.22** (2026-10-02): **Upstream test suites for `node` and `webapi`; Phase 11 outranks Phase 13** (plan-notes 305). New T11.7: Node's own `test/parallel` slice, pinned to `.node-version` and fetched rather than vendored, runs through vitest with a strict-TS `common` and `node:assert`, ratcheted, and adds a column to `docs/NODE.md`. New T13.6 does the same for web-platform-tests `dom/` and `css/cssom/`. Phase 11 is now `P1` and Phase 13 is `P3`.
- **v4.23** (2026-10-02): **Task 6.17 — test impact selection** (plan-notes 293). Creator-directed: on pull requests and locally, build and run only the tests whose execution reaches a changed line, through TypeScript and on into the C/Zig runtime, using a per-test coverage map recorded by the full run on `main`. Falls back to the full run when the map cannot be trusted; `test:affected` is replaced.
- **v4.24** (2026-10-02): **Task 6.19 lands: the self-compilation ratchet** (plan-notes 306). `pnpm run test:selfhost` runs `explain --json` over `packages/compiler` and each `packages/std` module, compares verdicts and per-code counts with `packages/tests/selfhost/baseline.json`, builds the `std` modules and runs the `std_*` goldens. It runs in `ci` (38–47 s). The `FirstNode` message now names `QualifiedName`. The Task 6.19 card shrinks to its standing rules and the unbuilt stage-2 check.
- **v4.25** (2026-10-02): **Self-compilation counts may grow when recorded** (plan-notes 306). The creator answered 306's open question: a change that raises a `test:selfhost` count records it with `--update` in the same change, and review sees the diff.
- **v4.27** (2026-10-02): **T10.1 lands: the `std/fs` Promise twins are not-yet** (plan-notes 307). `readTextAsync`, `writeTextAsync`, `statAsync`, `mkdirAsync`, `unlinkAsync` and `rmdirAsync` — each sync call's name plus `Async` — are `STA1214` naming Phase 10 (T10.2's thread pool) in both modes, instead of the checker's "no exported member" (`STA0012`, which every other missing name keeps). No new code. Subset rows `subset_std_fs_async_ts`/`_js`, `subset_std_fs_missing_ts`; docs/STD.md §2, SUBSET.md, DIAGNOSTICS.md (STA0012 row). T10.1 moves to `done.md`.
