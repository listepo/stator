# plan-notes.md

Evidence log for contradictions between `plan.md` and reality, and for decisions the plan told
us to record. Newest first. Every entry names the plan section it touches and says whether
`plan.md` was edited in the same change (AGENTS.md golden rule 6).
## 273. Phase 7 closes: 7.1/7.2/7.3 Checks re-verified, evidence moved to done.md (2026-09-16)

**Plan:** §10 Phase 7 (stamped ✅ COMPLETE). `plan.md` edited in this change (§10 compressed
to stub + Check; full step text moved to `done.md` → Phase 7, which gains the three records
§10 cited but never wrote: 7.1 steps 1–2, 7.1 steps 6–9, 7.2 steps 3–8).

**Verification (all on `9f2eba4`, pinned Node 26.7.0, branch `agent/infra-next`; docs-only
changes since, so the numbers stand):** `packages/tests/ffi/run.ts` → 5 checks, 5 passed,
0 failed, 0 not run; `example-c-consumer/c-consumer.ts` → `ffi c-consumer: ok`;
`examples/ffi/sqlite/sqlite-c-main.ts` → `ffi sqlite-c-main: ok`;
`sqlite-demo.ts` → `sqlite demo: ok`; libm/stat examples ok; full `pnpm run ci` green
(check-node v26.7.0; typecheck/lint/dupes clean; unit 564/564; runtime corpus matches Node;
subset 677 — 639 passed, 38 expected-fail, 0 failed; golden 386/386 + 2 intl skipped;
builtins 223/238; leak 10M plateau 3664 KB; golden-asan green). The CI side of the Check is
structural (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` ffi job: `test:ffi` + both C-main runners) and was not
re-run remotely here — the job definition is unchanged since the 7.3 landing.

**Two honesty notes.** (1) §15.1's top-down rule gates phase STARTS; Phases 5 and 6 are still
open while 7 closes. This stamp records completed work, it does not start anything, so the
rule does not apply to it — stated here so the overlap reads as deliberate, not drift.
(2) The close-out names two follow-ups as explicitly unowned (ambient `CString`/`Out` lib
declarations; generator convention transfer — plan-notes 271): never Check items, no phase
owner, a future card owns them.

**§15.9 reassignment (same change, not a second card).** The stamp surfaced three `phase: 7`
sites under `src/`, which the rule forbids leaving behind: the optional extern call is
DELIVERED (direct C call — `?.` on an always-linked callee cannot short-circuit, so there
is no conditional to model; gate identifier arm + call arm + lowering agree, `STA4031`
landing-pad removed), while extern-as-value (STA1217) and bare package imports (STA1214)
go PHASELESS — messages name the blocker (no C value representation; v1 npm non-goal),
never a phase number, since no open phase owns either. `COMPLETED_PHASES` gains 7 in the
same change (`phases.test.ts` pins the pair). Proof: `subset_extern_optional_call_{ts,js}`
at `static`, the `?.` lines in both `extern_libm` goldens byte-exact, `phases.test.ts` 4/4.


## 278. Bound class expressions land via descriptor erasure (2026-09-16)

**Plan:** §8 step 12(d) (class member surface: anonymous classes, extends forms) + 12(e)
(class-as-value remainder, narrowed). `plan.md` NOT edited in this change — no task language
changes; 12(d)/12(e) remainders stay open.

**What landed.** `const C = class …` (named or not) emits the same descriptor a declaration
does, under Node's `.name` (inner name, else variable), and binds no value: every in-place
use (`new C`, `C.static`, `o instanceof C`, `extends C`, the inner name in the class body)
erases to the expression (decision fixtures `subset_class_expression_{ts,js}` flipped to
`static`, plus opaque/`let`/generic refusal pairs; goldens `class_expression.{ts,js}`
byte-for-byte vs Node 26.7.0; `docs/SUBSET.md` row added):

- Type model (`frontend/types.ts`): `classTypeToHType` names bound expressions (unbound stay
  Unknown); `ancestry`/`heritageSubstitution`/`baseDescriptorName`/`methodDeclaringClass`/
  `accessorDeclaringClass`/`staticMemberOf`/`baseClassOf` widen to `ClassLike`; new
  `classExpressionTarget` (variable→expression, single-`const`, alias-chasing),
  `innerClassExpression` (inner name + lexical containment, no scope work),
  `expressionClassName`, `classLikeOf`, `classDisplayName`.
- Gate (`gate.ts`): bound non-generic expressions vet like declarations; the formation must
  be single-`const`-bound (else the old messages); identifier uses erase in place and refuse
  opaque as class-as-value (import/export specifiers exempt, like aliases); `new`,
  `instanceof`, `super.m`, computed keys, assignability, and `#brand` all resolve
  expressions.
- Lowering (`lower/index.ts`): the formation emits the class (display-name scope
  registration for shadowing, no value binding); instance type from the construct
  signature's return; `lowerClass` widened (identity, layout, vtable, statics, stubs all
  ride); owner/dispatch resolution via `receiverClassLike`; abstract stubs and static runs
  compose (verified by probe, not separately pinned).
- Printing answers Node's name (`D { … }` for `const C = class D`), shadowing renames per
  step 23, cross-file imports erase through the alias, `extends C` grounds prefix layouts
  with virtual dispatch, and `#private` mangles by display name.

**Still refused (all probed):** unbound expressions (no identity), `let`/`var` formations
(reassignable), generic expressions (no specialization home — 12(f)), anonymous default
declarations (12(d) residue), opaque uses incl. `typeof C` and `C.prototype` (class object
— 12(e)), `switch`-guarded and loop/arrow supers, `super` in static blocks, `this` in
static members.

**Observed adjacent, NOT caused, NOT fixed:** a nested class (declaration OR expression)
whose method captures a local segfaults (`counter()` probe, exit 139 — the declaration
twin crashes identically on unmodified logic). No golden covers it; filing here so the
capture owner finds it. Nested-class capture is outside this session's scope.

## 277. Derived constructors may call super from if/else arms when no initializers splice (2026-09-16)

**Plan:** §8 step 12(d) (class member surface). `plan.md` NOT edited in this change — no task
language changes; the 12(d) remainder stays open.

**What landed.** `derivedConstructorOrderOk` is now a recursive coverage analysis instead of
a top-level scan (gate.ts only — the lowering already lowers arm-supers as ordinary
statements, and its empty-prologue splice is a no-op exactly when the rule allows arms):

- A class with NO instance field initializers (public or `#private`) may call `super(...)`
  in `if`/`else` arms: one call per arm, every arm covered, no `this`/`super` read before
  the call on any path (nesting and `else if` chains recurse free). Uninitialized fields
  need no splicing; statics never enter the constructor.
- The invariant is now EXACTLY-once per path, uniformly: a second call on a covered path —
  straight-line (`super(); super();`) or branch (`super(); if (f) super();`) — is refused,
  closing a live divergence (Node throws ReferenceError on a re-run; Stator double-ran the
  base). Coverage is tri-state (`covered`/`conditional`/`none`) so a call after a
  half-covering `if` still refuses, at any nesting depth.
- Still refused, each probed: initializers + arms, loops, arrows/nested functions, `try`,
  `switch`, `super` or `this` in a condition, reads before the call, missing-`else` paths.
  Condition-`this` and arrow-super are checker-refused first (both modes); the gate checks
  are defense in depth for shapes the checker misses.

**Tests.** Decision fixtures `subset_class_super_late_{ts,js}` extended (branch ctors);
goldens `class_super_late.{ts,js}` extended (nesting, `else if`, unbraced arms, post-`if`
reads) — byte-for-byte vs Node. Unit pins in `class-members.test.ts` rewritten to the new
rule (acceptance + HIR shape; initializer and re-run refusals) — the two failures that
surfaced the behavior change, fixed in the same commit, never in bulk.

**Not in this change.** `switch` arms (same principle, unbuilt), `try`-guarded calls, and
explicit-object-return paths (refused as before).

## 276. Static fields after static blocks initialize in source order (2026-09-16)

**Plan:** §8 step 12(d) (class member surface). `plan.md` NOT edited in this change — no task
language changes; the 12(d) remainder stays open.

**What landed.** The gate's `a static field after a static initialization block` refusal is
gone; fields and blocks execute in source order (subset fixtures
`subset_static_block_{ts,js}` extended, both `static`; golden
`tests/golden/ts/class_static_block.ts` extended with a two-block interleave plus an
uninitialized later field — byte-for-byte vs Node 26.7.0):

- Lowering (`lower/index.ts`): static field initializers partition into runs split by blocks
  (`staticFieldRuns`); the first run initializes with the class as before, each later run
  assigns after its block. The declaration still carries every static binding (later-run
  fields as `undefined` slots), so pre-registration, TDZ-shape behavior, and the
  method-hoisting divergence are all unchanged — only execution order moved. Static METHODS
  stay hoisted with the class (defining one runs nothing), as do static accessors.
- Later-run assignments mirror the declaration's own value shape (no boundary, same as if
  initialized with the class), only later; uninitialized later fields need nothing.

**Sharp edges, all checker-held.** Any block touching a later field is TS2448 (`used before
its initialization`) in BOTH modes — js mode does not suppress it (TDZ is unmodelled by
design, step 2a(c)'s open half) — so only non-touching shapes reach the new lowering, and a
block write to a later field (`C.a = 5` before `static a = 1`) is refused the same way
Node's TDZ would fail it at run time. Verified: `static { C.a }` + later `static a`
refuses identically in ts and js.

## 275. Abstract classes and members land via throw-stubs (2026-09-16)

**Plan:** §8 step 12(d) (class member surface). `plan.md` NOT edited in this change — no task
language changes; the 12(d) remainder stays open.

**What landed.** `abstract` classes with abstract methods and properties compile in both
modes (decision fixtures `subset_abstract_class_{ts,js}.ts`, both `static`; golden
`tests/golden/ts/abstract_class.ts` — three-level chain with a middle abstract class, an
abstract property, base-typed reads, an inherited concrete method, statics, `instanceof` —
byte-for-byte vs Node 26.7.0):

- Gate (`gate.ts`): a bodiless method with the `abstract` modifier skips the
  overload-signature arm (the implementation lives in a subclass, not in this class). The
  override check above still runs, so abstract-over-field stays refused; abstract properties
  needed no change (uninitialized fields already lower to `undefined` slots).
- Predicate (`frontend/types.ts`): `hasAbstractModifier`, beside `isStaticMember` (shared
  home — gate and lowering both use it, no duplication).
- Lowering (`lower/index.ts`): abstract members collect into `abstractStubs` (dropped for
  generic carriers like every other member list) and lower to a synthesized throw-stub —
  receiver parameter zero, mirrored parameter list, `throw new TypeError('abstract method
  …')`. The stub keeps the base's method table complete and gives direct calls a target;
  virtual dispatch always lands on the runtime class's concrete entry, and every path that
  could reach the stub is checker-refused first (abstract construction TS2511, missing
  override TS2515, `super.m()` on abstract — all verified `STA0012` in both modes).
- Async/generator flags stay false on the stub (a synchronous throw transfers before any
  promise or iterator is built); parameter defaults are dropped (a default that runs means
  the call reached a body that never runs).

**Deliberately not in this change: abstract ACCESSORS.** An accessor re-declaring an
inherited name stays refused (`overriding the inherited member 'y'`), because accessor
reads dispatch `direct` (`accessorCall`) while methods virtualize — abstract accessors
cannot override without virtual accessor dispatch, which is its own slice. The bodiless
rule still refuses them with the existing message; the lowering's stub list already accepts
the shape when that slice lands.

## 274. TS2416 override-widening lands: inferred method-method suppression + call widening (2026-09-16)

**Plan:** §8 step 12(d) (override rules) + step 2a(b) wake (plan-notes 68, 272). `plan.md` NOT
edited in this change — no task language changes; the 12(d) remainder stays open.

**What landed.** js mode no longer rejects legal JavaScript when an INFERRED override narrows
a return type (`subset_override_widening_js.js` out of expected-fail, `static`; new ts twin
`subset_override_widening_ts.ts` pins `STA0012`; golden
`tests/golden/js/class_override_widening.js` byte-for-byte vs Node 26.7.0):

- `program.ts`: a 2416-shaped suppression with a fail-closed predicate
  (`isInferredMethodOverrideMismatch`) — both members bodied `MethodDeclaration`s with
  identifier names, neither carrying a TS or JSDoc type (`methodIsUnannotated`), base found
  through the `extends` chain (aliases included). Anything else keeps `STA0012`, exactly per
  note 68 ("an error about an annotation the user wrote must still be an error"): annotated
  pairs (verified: `m(): string` vs `m(): number` still refuses in js), field-field pairs (one
  slot, two types — no call-widening can defend that shape), accessor pairs (the gate refuses
  them on its own), computed names, bodiless members, unresolvable bases.
- Both declarations' symbols seed `runtimeDynamicSymbols`; the lowering's returns edge widens
  calls resolving to either (`collectDynamicReturnsPass`: a `MethodDeclaration` whose own FQN
  is seeded marks its calls — methods only, so no existing variable/parameter seed can reach
  the arm). Declarations keep their types (the step-45 shape), so overload and vtable
  contracts are untouched; a base-typed read of a derived instance (JSDoc `@param {A}`)
  answers the derived value instead of garbage (probed `1`/`x`, matching Node).
- The file verdict is honestly `static`: the widened call feeds an export edge whose tag
  check settles it (`boundary-check` reports the type it produced), so no Unknown survives —
  a virtual call plus a check, no shape table. Unannotated/dynamic receivers stay dynamic as
  before (the golden covers both).

**Not in this change.** Field-involved 2416 stays `STA0012` in js too (real refusal, one slot
two types — same judgment shape as wave 4's field-vs-method TS2416). Function-scope
method-override keeps the gate's `STA1214` (per-evaluation tables); the suppression may move
such a program from `STA0012` to that `STA1214`, which names the true blocker.

## 272. Step-12(e)/41-42 drift check: no contradiction, only breadth; 2a(b) closed; Phase-5 header updated (2026-09-16)

**Plan:** §8 Phase 5 header, step 2a(b), step 12(e). `plan.md` edited in this change.

**No contradiction between 12(e) and steps 41-42.** Step 41 is bare GENERICS as value
(done.md → Phase 5 wave 5), not class-as-value; step 42 is the `super.m` tear-off, while bare
`super` stays refused (`gate.ts:471,4749`) — correctly, since a memberless `super` is a
JavaScript SyntaxError with no value to lower. Opaque class uses stay refused
(`gate.ts:893,908,5048`; done.md → Phase 5 wave 4; `subset_class_alias_opaque_*` pin the
verdict). So 12(e)'s "still open are a class used as a value and `super` as a value" remains
true and is narrowed by this edit to name exactly the open shapes: opaque class uses
(including class expressions) and bare `super`.

**Step 2a(b) is closed — all three buckets landed.** 2683 went in as the OPTION
`noImplicitThis: mode === 'ts'` (`program.ts:351`; done.md → Phase 5 wave 4, dynamic `this`),
2769 as the overload-fallback acceptance (`hasFunctionImplementation` in `gate.ts`; wave 4),
2464 as a js-mode suppression (`JS_MODE_RUNTIME_CODES`, `program.ts:190`). 2464 verified
end-to-end on the pinned Node 26.7.0: `{ [kObj]: 1 }` under `--mode=js` compiles and prints
`{"[object Object]":1}` (ToPropertyKey coercion, matching Node byte-for-byte); the same
source under `--mode=ts` keeps `STA0012`. Fully-dynamic computed keys in both modes take the
dynamic path (`{ [k]: v }` with `k: string` compiles and runs in ts and js).

**Genuinely open in (b)'s wake:** TS2416 override-widening
(`tests/subset/subset_override_widening_js.js`, plan-notes 68) — a bucket the (b) sweep never
named, owned by 12(d)'s override rules: js mode still rejects legal JavaScript when an
INFERRED override narrows a return type. Landing it (suppression gated on both members being
unannotated, per note 68's "an error about an annotation the user wrote must still be an
error", plus call-widening so base-typed reads stay sound) is this session's first family.

**Header fixed.** §8's "still OPEN … steps 18–38" predates waves 5–7 (steps 39–46) and the (b)
landings; rewritten to the current open set. Step 12(c)'s spread residue and 12(f) are
untouched — other agents own them.

Baselines at branch start (`agent/p5-class-surface`, pinned Node 26.7.0): subset 675
fixtures (637 passed, 38 expected-fail, 0 failed), golden 386/386, unit 564/564.


## 242. CI run 34778195179: shard 1 died in the checker's stack overflow through the in-process path 213 missed (2026-09-14)

**Plan:** §9 Task 6.1 (the Test262 heartbeat) and the CI decomposition map in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`. `plan.md` is NOT edited in this change — no task language changes.
The `-7` ratchet question at the end stays with Task 6.1's owner per 210, which this note
deliberately does not override.

**What was actually red.** Three independent failures plus one consequence — and the first
report misdescribed the first of them, so the log is the record here, not the report:

1. `static analysis`: `oxlint` clean, `typecheck` clean, then `oxfmt --check` failing on four
   files (`codegen/index.ts`, `frontend/gate.ts`, `frontend/types.ts`, `lower/index.ts`). No
   TypeScript crash in this job — the `RangeError` never appears in its section.
2. `test262 conformance (shard 1/8)`: `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` out of
   `typescript@6.0.3` (`getTypeOfExpression` ↔ `getContextualTypeForObjectLiteralMethod` cycle)
   on `test/language/expressions/object/method-definition/generator-prop-name-yield-expr.js`.
   The shard uploaded no artifact.
3. `test262 conformance` (aggregate): `Error: expected 8 shards under shards, found 7` — the
   mechanical consequence of (2).
4. `revert-on-failure`: the auto-revert commit was push-rejected (`refusing to allow a GitHub App
   to create or update workflow '.github/workflows/ci.yml' without 'workflows' permission`).

**The toolchain-pin path was investigated and rejected with measurements.** `npm view
typescript versions`: 6.x stable is 6.0.2 and 6.0.3 only — there is no newer 6.x patch to try.
A single-file repro (harnessed crasher through in-process `build()`, seconds to run) crashes
identically on 6.0.2: not a patch regression. 5.9.3 (newest 5.x) has neither
`ScriptTarget.ES2025` nor any `lib.es2025.*` file, so the pin alone breaks the own-source
typecheck — and downgrading the program's lib to es2024 would move the whole ES2025 surface
(`Set.prototype.union` et al.) and with it the whole-corpus ratchet. A pin change is the wrong
fix: it trades one red gate for a conformance re-baseline. `typescript` stays at 6.0.3; no
version changes in this change at all.

**213 already characterized the crash; the hole was the in-process path.** 213 reproduced it
down to an 8-line program, proved it upstream (`tsc` 6.0.3 dies on the same file), allocated
`STA4072`, and guarded the CLI (`main()`'s catch-all, unit-tested). But the Test262 runner
calls `build()` in-process and only catches `BuildError`, so the `RangeError` escaped past
every guard, killed the shard, and cost the aggregate its input. The fix is one `try/catch` at
the choke point every in-process caller shares: `compileToC` rethrows `BuildError` untouched
and converts anything else to `BuildError('STA4072', …)` through a new shared
`internalErrorMessage()` helper that `main()`'s catch-all now also uses — CLI bytes identical
(the existing `cli.test.ts` STA4072 test still passes), `explain()` covered too since it shares
`compileToC`. A second unit test pins the in-process half: the 8-line repro rejects with
`BuildError` code `STA4072` and no `typescript.js` frame. The crasher now records
`failed` with `stator: STA4072 internal error: Maximum call stack size exceeded — …` instead
of killing its shard.

**This change, whole:** the `compileToC` guard + helper (`cli/build.ts`, `cli/main.ts`), the
in-process unit test (`tests/unit/cli.test.ts`), `oxfmt` applied to the four drifted files
(whitespace only), `loadShards` naming the missing shard(s) in its error, and a
skip-when-the-push-touched-`.github/` guard in `revert-on-failure` — least privilege over
granting the job `workflows: write`, which would let CI push workflow changes by itself.
Verified against history: the guard skips `cd62e75` (the workflow commit whose revert was
rejected) and still reverts `70c7109` (docs-only).

**Verification (Node v26.7.0, `.worktrees/ci-fix`, branch `fix/ci-ts-pin`).** `typecheck` clean,
`lint` clean (oxlint 0/0, oxfmt clean), unit 390/390, subset 372 fixtures 0 failed, runtime
archive builds. Shard 1 locally: exit 0, `305 passed, 6000 skipped, 393 failed of 6698`.
Aggregate of that shard plus run 34778195179's shards 2–8 artifacts: `2372 passed, 3100
failed, 48108 skipped` of 53,580 — exactly 210's 2026-09-09 whole-corpus measurement, same
43.3% pass rate.

**Deliberately NOT fixed here: the aggregate is still red on the `-7` ratchet** (`FAIL
ratchet: passed dropped from 2379 to 2372`). 210 measured the same `-7`, called it a
regression, and ruled the ratchet stays unmoved rather than bank someone else's regression as
a baseline — that ruling still holds, and this change does not touch `ratchet.json`. What this
note adds to 210: the 96 `test/annexB/language/function-code` skips with bare `STA1214` are
still there post-step-14, and the family is B.3.3 sloppy-mode semantics (catch-param plus
block-level function), which a strict-only compiler cannot pass wholesale — the pin-era
passes were strict-coincidences that 209's soundness refusal (block-fn shadowing → `STA1214`)
ended. Narrowing that refusal to the strict-coincident shapes is Phase-5 language work with
its own decision tests, in `gate.ts`, owned by that area — not a rider on a CI fix, and not
attributable in a tree with a second agent landing Phase-7 work in the main checkout (the fix
itself was therefore built in `.worktrees/ci-fix`, rebased onto `origin/main`).

**Merge warning (mechanical, not judgmental).** While the aggregate gate is red,
`revert-on-failure` reverts ANY push to `main` — as it already did to `70c7109` (`e6d5b94`).
Merging this branch before the `-7` lands (or the owner directs otherwise) gets this fix
reverted by the bot. The branch is the ready-to-land mechanical half; the `-7` is the gate.

## 256. Extern calls land (7.1 steps 4–5); audit gaps closed in docs (2026-09-14)

**Plan:** §10 Task 7.1 steps 4–5 (landed below; steps 6+ open). `plan.md` edited in this change.

Implementation arrived as one coherent change (extern surface reader, HIR node, gate arms,
verifier STA4098, emitter, explain flag, libm goldens, 17 decision fixtures, 13 unit tests).
Close-out reconciliation against the contract audit found the code sound and the docs behind
in eight places, all fixed in `docs/FFI.md` (CString returns, exact brand rule, `any`→STA1114,
overloads, untagged-ambient fate, STA1217 scope, convention↔return matrix verified against
`externConventionMismatch`, §8 carved out of the sole-allocator claim), plus the MODES.md
`externCalls` field, the DIAGNOSTICS STA1119 void-clause narrowed to the checkable form, and
the plan step-2 table pointed at FFI.md as authoritative. Two audit findings confirmed
non-issues by reading code: branded-pointer `null`-convention interplay is moot (pointers
defer as STA1217 before conventions apply), and `explain`'s flag is optional-absent
(byte-identical reports preserved). Remaining for steps 6+: link plumbing (`--link`, header
pragma provenance — FFI.md has no step-7 section yet), ambient `CString` lib decls, `T**`,
and the Task 7.2 STA1122–1124 allocations.

## 255. Duplication gate green (6.11): extracts land, prose stays by decision (2026-09-14)

**Plan:** §9 Task 6.11 (landed below). `plan.md` edited in this change.

`cpd .` exits 0 at 68 clones · 0.7% (was 99 · 1.0% red): compiler top-3 extractions,
CI YAML anchors, runtime C helpers, differential ignore narrowed to artifacts (the three
harness sources appear in the scan), unit-test helpers extracted with all 396 tests
preserved. Step-17's display-name follow-ups and the `typeAt` fast path rode the same
refactor wave (own evidence in their sessions' reports; behavior proof is the green suites).
Deliberately NOT done: markdown prose echo (TOOLCHAIN/done/plan quotations are historical
Check evidence — rewriting the archive to satisfy the detector trades honesty for a number)
and sub-threshold trivia; every remaining pair has a documented reason, threshold untouched
per the card. 6.11 therefore closes by measurement + decision, not by zero clones.

## 254. Batch close: test262 guard lands; dupes paydown progress; 6.12 implemented, open (2026-09-14)

**Plan:** §9 Task 6.14 (landed below); 6.11 stays open; 6.12 implemented but open. `plan.md`
edited in this change (6.14 card + landing).

**6.14 (test262 guard).** `buildInProcess`'s catch converts checker-stack `RangeError` to an
STA4072 failure (narrow `/call stack/i` match; OOM rethrows). Proof: synthetic mini-corpus dies
raw without the guard, reports `0 passed, 0 skipped, 1 failed` with it; full shard 1 completes
(305 passed, 6000 skipped, 393 failed of 6698, exit 0) where it deterministically died before;
`--shard=1/200` shape unchanged (13/238/17). Ratchet refresh still needs one full green run and
is scheduled, not done — the aggregate may still fail on stale numbers (passed 2372 < 2379).

**Dupes paydown (6.11 partial).** Three agents, three layers, zero behavior change:
compiler top-3 extractions (`checkMethodReceiver`, call-shape emitter helpers,
`lowerReceiverCall`/`padToArity`) + display-name follow-ups (var/assignment/chain positions,
fixtures extended append-only) + `typeAt` empty-set fast path → `cpd .` 97 → 68 clones
(1.0% → 0.7%); CI workflow repetitions → YAML anchors (322 → 302 lines, effective-equality
proven by parse-compare); runtime C micro-clones → same-file `static` helpers (22 → 8 entries
in `runtime/src`, corpus re-proven below). What remains for 6.11's Check: markdown prose echo,
test boilerplate, residual code clones, and narrowing the differential ignore — plus the
threshold question the card leaves to the owner (do not raise it unilaterally).

**6.12 (exact pin) implemented, stays open.** `mise.toml` selects exact `26.7.0` (was already
installed — zero-download switch); `check-node.mjs` compares full versions (running, oracle,
and a `mise.toml`-vs-`.node-version` drift regex; `engines >=24` stays a range floor by design).
Verified: exact match prints clean, bun-oracle and drifted pins fail fast. Full suites re-run
on the true pin: subset 372, unit 396, golden 214/214. Stays open: its Check demands green
`pnpm run ci`, blocked by the red dupes gate and the stale ratchet — both owned elsewhere.

## 253. Differential flake fixed (6.10); intl skip line (6.13); error-code narrowing (2026-09-14)

**Plan:** §9 Tasks 6.10, 6.13 (landed below). `plan.md` edited in this change.

6.10: `finding()` re-checks `sameResult` on the final minimized run and drops transients (a
timeout finding re-runs once; the confirming run is the recorded evidence); the minimizer's
paren rewrite no longer eats call parentheses (negative lookbehind for identifier chars).
12 stale `failures/ts-*` artifacts deleted (all byte-identical node/stator or corrupted
`console.log0` minimizes — verified case by case); the dir is gitignored and now empty. Seed 58:
0 divergences; `--seed=1 --count=50 --mode=both`: 100 cases, 0 divergences. Drive-by in the same
files: `result.error?.code` did not typecheck (`Error` has no `code`; invisible to every gate —
the harness is excluded from tsconfigs, lint, and jscpd alike) — narrowed through `in`, proven
with direct strict `tsc` on both harness files. 6.13: default `test:golden` prints
`golden: SKIPPED 2 intl_* fixtures (…)`; gate unchanged.

NOT fixed, deliberately: SUBSET.md's "FFI returns are still Phase 6" pointer (flagged during
7.1 docs). The row covers boundary-checked narrowing behavior, and the done.md record behind it
says those values "need the builtin (§7 Task 4.2) and Phase 6" — Phase 6 as the proof venue
(differential evidence), not the feature owner. Flipping it to Phase 7 would assert an owner
change nobody decided; left for the owner, not guessed (AGENTS.md §15.6).

## 252. ASan hash-skip lands (6.8a): archive bytes lie, members don't; touch ≠ change (2026-09-14)

**Plan:** §9 Task 6.8 (landed below). `plan.md` edited in this change.

Two findings from the implementation, both now in-code comments. (1) Hashing `libjsrt.a`
BYTES can never match: BSD `ar`'s derived `__.SYMDEF` index embeds a fresh timestamp per
archival — four back-to-back no-change rebuilds hashed four ways while every member stayed
byte-identical. The gate hashes sorted member names + `ar p` member bytes instead (the linker
reads members + derived index, never the packaging); skip behavior validates it. (2) The
card's Check said "a runtime-source touch re-triggers" — a `touch` does NOT (correctly: the
rebuild is byte-identical, and a content gate must skip). Sensitivity proven with a real
2-line comment change instead (full pass green, new record); the Check is hereby redefined as
content-change re-triggers. Stages 1–2 stay unconditional; CI sets `STATOR_ASAN_FORCE=1`
(always full); the record (`packages/tests/.asan-last-green.json`, gitignored, tmp+rename on
green only) holds hash/commit/counts. Counts are 214 fixtures now (212 at card time + 2 step-17
goldens).

## 249. Parent-linked lowering scopes land: 57.7 → 11.0 µs/line, HIR-identical (2026-09-14)

**Plan:** §12 lowering-scope card (landed below). `plan.md` edited in this change.

`Scope.child()`/`functionScope()` (`src/lower/scope.ts`) linked instead of copying:
per-scope `own` maps + `parent`, chain-walking `has`/`get`/`hirName`, innermost-only `set`/`declare`.
Two deliberate sharings preserved: `unitDeclared` stays a shared per-unit `Set` (sibling-block
double-declaration detection needs cross-branch sharing no chain provides), and `declare()`'s
same-scope-vs-ancestor test is own-map-vs-chain. One semantic nuance vs copies: a parent binding
declared after a child is created is now visible in the child — every `child()`/`functionScope()`
interleaving audited (all created immediately before use), and the identity proofs below confirm
zero observable difference. `lower/index.ts` untouched (API unchanged); zero `jscpd` clones on
the file. Table (synthetic inputs, loadavg ~5 both columns):

| lines | before | before µs/line | after | after µs/line |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10,041 | 207 ms | 20.6 | 159 ms | 15.8 |
| 39,966 | 1,255 ms | 31.4 | 485 ms | 12.1 |
| 99,816 | 5,762 ms | 57.7 | 1,093 ms | 11.0 |
| 16,002 many-tiny | 809 ms | 50.6 | 48 ms | 3.0 |
| 15,714 few-big | 49 ms | 3.1 | 45 ms | 2.9 |

Independent attribution (second subagent, single-variable OLD↔NEW A/B, `diff -rq` confirming
only `scope.ts` differs): scope copies owned 81.9% of lower time at 4k tiny lines and 95.4% at
16k (64.0M entries copied — exactly 16× per 4× lines, quadratic proven at 32ns/entry); every
function paid the module map twice (`functionScope()` + body `child()`). Post-fix floor is flat
(7.0→6.2→5.7 µs/line). HIR sha256 identical OLD↔NEW on all 10 attribution inputs, plus a
372-fixture + shadow-torture HIR dump `cmp`-identical — two independent behavior proofs.
Unchanged by design: the depth-driven term (chain-walks replace copies 1:1 at depth 200) and the
newly-visible ceilings — deep-checker calls (`getSymbolAtLocation` 9µs/call at depth via
`typeAt`, `lower/index.ts:5548-5560`) and depth-superlinear captures (`analyzeCaptures` 0.85→14.3
ms at d1→d200, ~30% of that total), plus a `typeAt` empty-set fast path (~26% of checker time on
big files) as the cheapest next win — candidates, not cards.

## 251. Runtime and js-mode findings from the 2026-09-14 bug hunt (2026-09-14)

**Plan:** §8 Phase 5 gains steps 27–38. `plan.md` edited in this change.

Two sweeps — runtime builtins (`packages/runtime/src/`) and js-mode/control flow — each reproduced
every repro against the pinned Node 26.7.0. The js-mode sweep ran on a `git archive` snapshot at
`d1c820a` because the live tree was being edited; the findings below were re-verified on the live
tree where marked. All are untested surface (no golden covers them).

### A. Runtime builtins

- **A1 `ToNumber(string)` accepts `strtod` spellings.** `+"inf"`, `+"INFINITY"`, `"Inf"` → `Infinity`
  where Node answers `NaN`; `jsrt_numeric.c` `jsrt_string_to_number` falls through to `strtod` while
  `docs/NUMERIC.md` §6.3 says the conversion "is **not** `strtod`".
- **A2 no `0b`/`0o`.** `+"0b101"` → Node `5`, here `NaN`; `+"0o17"` → Node `15`, here `NaN`.
- **A3 signed hex accepted.** `+"-0x10"` → Node `NaN`, here `-16`.
- **A4 hex overflow saturates.** `+"0xffffffffffffffff"` → Node `18446744073709552000`, here
  `9223372036854776000` (`strtol` + `ERANGE` ignored).
- **A5 Unicode whitespace / trailing VT → `NaN`.** `+"\u00a01"` → Node `1`, here `NaN`; `+"1\u000b"`
  likewise.
- **A6 256-code-unit cap.** `"1" + "0".repeat(300)` → Node `1e+300`, here `NaN`.
- **A7 fixed-shape objects ignore `OrdinaryOwnPropertyKeys`.** `const o = { b: 1, "1": 2, a: 3 }`:
  `Object.keys(o)` here `[ 'b', '1', 'a' ]` vs Node `[ '1', 'b', 'a' ]`, and `JSON.stringify` /
  `console.log` follow the same order. The fixed arm uses declaration order
  (`jsrt_object_ops.c:47`, `jsrt_print.c:736`); the dynamic path is correct, which is why
  `JSON.parse` objects already pass. plan-notes 85's invariant ("integer-like keys cannot trigger")
  is falsified by the string-literal keys note 181 landed.
- **A8 quoted keys do not escape control characters.** `console.log({ "a\nb": 1 })` prints a real
  newline and breaks the layout; `append_key` (`jsrt_print.c:635`) has no `<0x20` branch.
- **A9 lone surrogates print as U+FFFD.** `console.log(["\ud800A"])` → Node `[ '\ud800A' ]`, here
  `[ '\ufffdA' ]`.
- **A10 VT escapes as `\v`, Node uses `\x0B`.** (`jsrt_print.c:286`.)
- **A11 the depth cap abbreviates EMPTY containers.** `console.log([[[[]]]])` → Node `[ [ [ [] ] ] ]`,
  here `[ [ [ [Array] ] ] ]`; same for `{}`, `Map(0)`, empty class instances
  (`jsrt_print.c:501/684/776` check depth before emptiness).
- **A12 `repeat`/`padStart`/`padEnd` cap is 2^31−1, Node's is 2^29−24 (536870888).**
  `"ab".repeat(300000000)` → Node `RangeError`, here `600000000`. (`jsrt_string_ops.c:267/287`;
  note 203 chose 2^31−1, which the pinned Node disagrees with.)
- **A13 `Date.parse` leniencies.** `"2020-01-01T00:00:00.5Z"` and `"...+0530"` → Node timestamps,
  here `NaN` (exactly-3 fractional digits and a `+HH:MM` colon are required, `jsrt_date.c:669/680`).
- **A14 `ToString` of Map/Set/RegExp/Date is `[object Object]`.** `"" + new Map()` → Node
  `[object Map]`; `"" + /abc/g` → Node `/abc/g`; `"" + new Date(0)` → Node the date string.
  `jsrt_to_string` (`jsrt_print.c:1771`) has no arm for them.
- **A15 `matchAll` iterator prints as `Iterator {}`** where Node prints
  `Object [RegExp String Iterator] {}` (`jsrt_iterator.c:19`).
- **A16 object literal `{ __proto__: 1 }` is an own data property.** Node treats the spelling as the
  prototype setter: `JSON.stringify({ __proto__: 1, a: 1 })` → `{"a":1}`, here
  `{"__proto__":1,"a":1}`.
- **A-ICE `"5" * 1` in js mode** → `STA4011 internal error in binary-op: arithmetic operand must be
  number, got string` (ts mode gives the proper `STA0012`).

### B. js mode and control flow

- **B1 `for...of` never calls IteratorClose on abrupt exit.** A `break` out of a generator's loop
  does not run its `finally`:
  `function* g() { try { yield 1; yield 2; } finally { console.log("closed"); } } for (const v of
  g()) { if (v === 1) break; } console.log("after");` → Node `closed / after`, here `after`.
  Same for `return`/`throw` out of the body, in both modes; `continue` is correct. No
  `jsrt_iterator_close` exists and `emitBoxedIteratorForOf` (`codegen/index.ts:2014`) only closes the
  per-iteration lexical env.
- **B2/B3 Promise ordering.** Adoption is one microtask eager
  (`Promise.resolve(1).then(() => Promise.resolve(2)).then(() => console.log("adopt"))` lands
  before the third `.then` chain in Stator, after it in Node), and `finally` skips the spec's
  pass-through wrapper (`.finally().then()` ordering differs). `jsrt_promise_settle`
  (`jsrt_promise.c:153`) and `finally_react` (`:324`).
- **B4 `ToString(error)` is `[object Object]`.** `` `${new Error("boom")}` `` → Node `Error: boom`,
  here `[object Object]`; `TypeError`/`RangeError` too. Same `jsrt_to_string` gap as A14.
- **B6 an object-literal method that captures a local or parameter SEGFAULTS.**
  `function counter() { let n = 0; return { get() { return n; } }; } counter().get();` → exit 139
  (Node `0`). `codegen`'s `object-literal` case emits entries only and never binds `expr.methods`; the
  call site rebuilds the closure with `currentEnv()` (NULL at top level). Without isolation the same
  shape returns garbage instead (`4 5 5` for Node `1 2 2`) — UB, not just a crash.
- **B7–B10 suppressed checker diagnostics become internal errors.**
  `const x = 5; x()` → `STA4041` (the verifier still trusts "the checker would have rejected it",
  but js mode suppresses TS2349); `f(...arr)` on a user function → `STA4031 unexpected expression
  kind: SpreadElement`; `c.missing` on a class instance → `STA4060 no field 'missing' on C`
  (TS2339 suppressed); `{ a: 1, 10: 2 }` → `STA4068 object literal member is not a name/value pair`
  (`staticObjectLiteralKey` does not handle `NumericLiteral`). Every one throws where Node answers
  or runs.
- **B11 a dynamic method call on a dynamic value panics `STA2006`.** `function id(v) { return v; }
  id([1, 2, 3]).join("|")` → Node `1|2|3`, here SIGABRT. The gate explicitly accepts `o.m()` on an
  `unknown` receiver (`gate.ts:1677-1690`) but the dynamic read has no prototype fallback. This is
  note 223 item 6c generalized (step 20).
- **B12 `for...in` over an array panics `STA4084`.** `for (const k in [10, 20]) console.log(k);`
  prints `0 / 1` in Node and aborts `PANIC: STA4084: Object.keys/values/entries on a non-object
  value` (exit 134) here, in both modes; `for...in` over an object literal is correct. The lowering
  emits `jsrt_object_keys` (`lower/index.ts:2306`), which the runtime rejects for an array.

## 250. Six miscompiles in the recently shipped object-literal / class / optional-chaining surface (2026-09-14)

**Plan:** §8 Phase 5 gains steps 22–26. `plan.md` edited in this change.

A sweep of the step-12/13/14/15/16 families with small Node-vs-Stator diffs; every one below was
re-verified independently at HEAD on the pinned Node 26.7.0 (ts and js where noted). None is
covered by a golden or decision fixture, which is why the suite is green.

**1. Computed key with a literal-typed identifier: dynamic build, static read → garbage.**
`const k = "dyn"; const o = { [k]: 1 }; console.log(o.dyn);` prints `2e-323` (uninitialised
memory; the value changes per run) where Node prints `1`. `objectLiteralIsDynamic` /
`computedKeyIsLayoutKey` (`frontend/types.ts:458-492`) call `[k]` runtime-dynamic without consulting
`checker.getTypeAtLocation(key)`, while the binding's type stays a fixed shape, so construction
emits `jsrt_dynobj_new` and the read emits `jsrt_object_get_field`. Silent wrong answer.

**2. Dynamic object-literal methods are dropped.** `DynObjectLiteral` (`hir/nodes.ts:403`) has no
`methods` field and `lower/index.ts:3176` discards the `methodNodes` it collected. Three faces:
`const k="dyn"; const o = { [k]: 2, m() { return 1; } }; console.log(o.m());` is a compile-time
`STA4072` internal error; with a runtime-computed key it compiles and then panics
`STA2006 calling a non-function` (exit 134); with a computed key + method + accessor,
`typeof o.m` is `undefined` and then the same panic.

**3. Shadowed class declarations share one identity.** Classes never go through `Scope.declare`
(`lower/index.ts:5039`), and the descriptor is keyed by source name (`codegen/index.ts:1074`), so an
inner `class C` resolves to the outer one:

```ts
class C { m(): string { return "outer"; } }
{ class C { m(): string { return "inner"; } } console.log(new C().m()); }
console.log(new C().m());       // Node: inner / outer     Stator: outer / outer
```

Sibling blocks and class-in-function shadowing fail the same way; a differing member set aborts with
`STA4072`.

**4. `?.` optional chaining is accepted and compiled as a plain access.** No `questionDotToken`
handling exists in `lower/` or `gate.ts`; the emitted access is unconditional:
`const o: { a?: { b?: number } } = {}; console.log(o.a?.b);` answers `undefined` in Node and throws
an uncaught `TypeError` (exit 1) in Stator, in both modes. Worse, the decision fixture
`subset_optional_chaining_ts.ts` is `@expected-fail: true` with `@verdict: static` while the gate
returns `dynamic`, so the runner hides the construct instead of failing on it.

**5. `this` inside an arrow in a class field initializer → `STA4072 Undefined identifier: this`.**
`enclosingNonArrowFunction` (`lower/captures.ts:89`) finds no non-arrow ancestor for a field
initializer at module scope, so the receiver is never captured:
`class Counter { n = 0; inc = (): number => { this.n += 1; return this.n; }; }
console.log(new Counter().inc());` is `1` in Node and a compile-time `STA4072` in Stator.

**6. `js` mode rejects duplicate object keys.** `const a = { x: 1, x: 2 }; console.log(a.x);` is
`STA0012 [js] An object literal cannot have multiple properties with the same name.` where Node
prints `2`. Duplicate keys are legal JS (last wins) and §1.2 says js mode never rejects untyped
code; the diagnostic is tsc's grammar check TS1117 with no js-mode carve-out.

**Tested and clean:** step-14 shadowing of `let`/`const`/parameters/functions across nested and
sibling blocks, switch clauses, loop bodies and catch params; step-13 module-scope loop captures;
step-15 `await`/`yield` in per-iteration loops; step-16 optional interfaces, index signatures and the
Error interfaces; step-12 static object literals, class method values, static/spread/accessor
members, inheritance and overrides.

## 249. The 2026-09-14 bug hunt: note 223's defects were never carded, `console` is unary, and four tooling faults (2026-09-14)

**Plan:** §8 Phase 5 gains steps 18–21; §9 Phase 6 gains tasks 6.10–6.13. `plan.md` edited in this
change.

Three sweeps at HEAD on the pinned Node 26.7.0: a compiler/runtime probe over ~60 generated
programs and over the recent step-12/13/14/15/16 families, a built-in edge-case sweep, and a
read-only audit of `packages/tests/` + `scripts/`. Unit (390) and subset (372 — 351 passed, 21
expected-fail, 0 failed) are green, so everything below is untested surface. The sweeps also
surfaced one environmental hazard worth stating: another session was editing
`packages/compiler/src/lower/index.ts` during the run, and a momentarily invalid file made every
compile fail with Node's `ERR_INVALID_TYPESCRIPT_SYNTAX` — those were discarded, not counted.

**1. Note 223's items 3–6 are still unfixed and were never in `plan.md`.** Every repro below was
re-run at this HEAD; none is covered by a card, so `plan.md` alone cannot see the work. They become
steps 20–21.

```js
// (3) spread enumerates in the TYPE's field order, not the object's key order
/** @type {{y: number, x: string}} */
const o = { x: "s", y: 2 };
console.log(Object.keys({ ...o }).join(","));      // Node: x,y    Stator: y,x

// (4) fn.length on an untyped function value
const g = (x) => x;
function arity(fn) { return fn.length; }
console.log(arity(g));                             // Node: 1      Stator: undefined

// (5) an array method on an `undefined` value the checker called an array
function add(v) { arr.push(v); }
add(1);
var arr = [];                                      // Node: TypeError, exit 1
console.log("after");                              // Stator: SIGSEGV, exit 139

// (6a) named capture group in a replacement
console.log("ab".replace(/(?<x>a)/, "[$<x>]"));    // Node: [a]b    Stator: [$<x>]b

// (6b) ISO hour 24 with non-zero minutes/seconds
console.log(Date.parse("2024-01-01T24:00:01Z"));   // Node: NaN     Stator: 1704153601000

// (6c) a method call on an Unknown receiver
function pushIt(a) { a.push(9); return a.length; }
console.log(pushIt([1, 2]));                       // Node: 3       Stator: PANIC STA2006, exit 134
```

(5) and (6c) are the memory-safety/crash pair: `jsrt_as_array` unboxes with no tag test (NULL from
`undefined`), and `jsrt_get_prop` walks shape tables only, never a class descriptor or a builtin
prototype, so an array-typed dynamic value panics where Node runs. Both need a tag check that
THROWS, which means codes allocated in `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md` (the sole allocator).

**2. `console`'s members are declared and implemented unary, so `console.log(a, b)` is a raw
checker error in `ts` mode.** `Console.log/info/debug/warn/error/dir` take one argument in
`src/frontend/lib/stator.globals.d.ts:19-29` and `CONSOLE_METHODS` (`hir/nodes.ts:981`) is
`arity: 1, optional: 0`; the runtime entry is `jsrt_print(jsrt_value)` / `jsrt_eprint`
(`runtime/include/jsrt_value.h:1369`). Node inspects each argument and joins with one space.

```text
console.log(1, "two", true)   Node: 1 two true    Stator ts: STA0012 "Expected 1 arguments"
                                                    Stator js: STA1214 "console.log with 3
                                                    arguments is not yet supported"
console.log()                 Node: (blank line)  Stator ts: STA0012 "Expected 1 arguments"
```

In `js` mode the gate's own `notYet(..., 5)` wins because `checkJs` suppresses the arity error; in
`ts` mode the checker's `STA0012` preempts it. Same source, two different diagnostic classes — and
`notYet(..., 5)` names Phase 5, which owns no step for console arity. Step 18.

**3. Variadic built-in argument forms name Phase 5 and no step owns them.** All confirmed at HEAD:
`xs.push(2, 3)` and `a.unshift(…)` → `STA1214 "… with other than one argument … planned for
Phase 5"`; insertion `splice` → `"… with other than two arguments …"`; `a.concat(b, c)` → `"concat
with anything but one array …"`; `String.fromCharCode(65, 66)` and `[1,2,3].lastIndexOf(1, 1)` →
the catch-all `"method calls are not yet supported"` / `"lastIndexOf with a position…"`. plan-notes
2293 records only that insertion `splice` "waits with variadic `push`"; §8's open list is step
2a(b)/(c) and 12(c)–(f), so the messages are a dead end the moment Phase 5 closes (§15.9). Step 19.

**4. Four tooling faults.**

- **The differential oracle can record a divergence it cannot reproduce.**
  `tests/differential/run.ts` `finding()` re-executes the minimized program (`final = execute(...)`)
  and saves/reports it without ever re-checking `sameResult(final.node, final.stator)`;
  `sameResult` counts a timeout as a divergence, and the minimizer preserves a candidate whose
  build timed out. Measured: `run.ts --minutes=4 --seed=1` reported `DIVERGENCE seed=58 mode=ts`,
  but the saved `ts-58.node.json` and `ts-58.stator.json` are byte-identical, and re-running seed 58
  three times gives 0 divergences. No runtime nondeterminism was found — normal exit and
  `jsrt_uncaught` both flush stdio. Task 6.10.
- **The minimizer corrupts call expressions.** `minimize.ts:24`
  `[/\([^()\n]+\)/g, '0']` cannot tell grouping parens from call parens:
  `console.log(0);` becomes `console.log0;`, which is the saved `failures/ts-407.min.js` and is a
  `STA0012` today. The file's own contract says "the returned source is always a reproducer."
  Task 6.10.
- **The Node pin is not exact and the preflight cannot see it.** `mise.toml:6` is `node = "26"`,
  which resolves to 26.8.2 on this host; `.node-version` is 26.7.0; `scripts/check-node.mjs`
  compares only the major, so it prints `node v26.8.2 matches .node-version (26.7.0)` and exits 0.
  plan.md §4 says the two files "already agree". Task 6.12.
- **`pnpm run dupes` is red at HEAD:** `cpd .` reports `99 clones · 1.0% duplication` and exits 1
  against `threshold: 1` (1.0158%, the report's own number). Most clones are markdown
  (`docs/TOOLCHAIN.md` ↔ `done.md`/`plan.md`) plus repeated code blocks in
  `codegen/index.ts`/`verify.ts`/`lower/index.ts`; `.jscpd.json` also excludes the whole
  `packages/tests/differential/**`, so the harness is never scanned. `pnpm run ci` runs `dupes`, so
  the gate is currently red. Task 6.11.

**5. Minor, recorded not carded.** The golden runner drops both `intl_*` fixtures when
`STATOR_RUNTIME` is not `intl` and prints no skip count, so a reader cannot tell two fixtures were
omitted; contrast `leak/run.ts` and `test262/run.ts`, which print their skips. Task 6.13.

## 248. Verifier ceiling landed yesterday (`b5da1d1`) — the plan still claimed it; lowering is next (2026-09-14)

**Plan:** §12 bullet rewritten (fixed half struck, lowering-scope card scheduled). `plan.md`
edited in this change.

Re-measurement (subagent, /tmp harness driving `lowerSourceFile`/`optimize`/`verifyHir`
directly on synthetic scope-hostile inputs, loadavg ~5): verify is ≤1 ms at 10.9k/44.9k/112.1k
lines — down from 190 ms / 3.6 s / 21.5 s (plan-notes 134). The parent-linked scopes §12
prescribed landed 2026-09-13 in `b5da1d1` (owner commit: verifier scopes + program cache +
tunable -O) without a plan update; `verify.ts` carries no `new Map(bindings)` copy (only
comments describing the old code). Same runs name the next ceiling: lowering is ~96% of the
measured front end and scales superlinearly (22→33→63 µs/line), and a shape experiment (3,200
tiny vs 460 big functions at equal ~16.1k lines: 99 vs 24 µs/line) implicates
`Scope.child()`/`functionScope()` (`src/lower/scope.ts`) duplicating the visible map per block
and per function. Absolute lower/ts-API numbers are load-inflated upper bounds; no load explains
a 21,500× verify delta. Incidental `new Map` sweep: captures/codegen hits are one-per-owner or
resets, benign — the two scope.ts copies are the only ceiling.

## 247. `-Wnull-character`: a shadow-renamed display name reaches C string literals (2026-09-14)

**Plan:** §8 new step 17 (open). `plan.md` edited in this change.

Triage (subagent, read-only): exactly one fixture emits a NUL byte —
`tests/golden/ts/module_loop_capture.ts` (offset 507 of its `--emit=c` output):
`JSRTClosure _jsrt_closure_2 = {…, "\0shadow:f#4", …}`. Mechanism: the fixture declares `f`
five times in one unit; the 2nd+ binding is step-14 alpha-renamed, and `codegen/index.ts:964`
promotes the HIR slot name to the closure display name, which `cNameLiteral` → `escapeCString`
(`:175-184`, escapes only `\ " ?`) passes through raw. All three lines predate Task 6.6 by
days–weeks (blames `50be291`, `fa13a50`, `0b7ec7fc`) — the in-process runner only made the
warning visible; the old spawn runner discarded clang stderr on success. Impact, honestly split:
in the culprit fixture the NUL static is unreachable (the live value is the heap closure, name
`""`) — cosmetic there, ASan-clean, output byte-exact. But the same sink is observably live: a
shadowed NON-capturing function prints `[Function (anonymous)]` where Node prints the source
name (repro in /tmp, no golden covers it), because every closure-name consumer stops at the
first NUL. Adjacent gap, same neighborhood: capturing arrows assigned to a const also print
anonymous where Node names them (lowering never back-fills arrow names from declarators).
Fix direction (step 17): carry the declarator's source spelling as the display name from the
lowering — the precedent already exists for declarations — plus optional `escapeCString`
hardening for C0 controls as defense in depth (silences clang, does not fix the divergence).

## 246. Bench noise floor, five repeats on this host: 7.4% — the 20% gate stands (2026-09-14)

**Plan:** §9 Task 6.3 residue narrowed, not closed. `plan.md` edited in this change (residue text).

Five full `bench:record` runs, same commit, loadavg 5.7–7.1 throughout (steady ambient load, never
quiet): geomeans 21.809 / 22.778 / 22.281 / 22.585 / 21.215 ms — max spread **7.4%** (prior single
repeat: 4.0%). Each geomean is already best-of-5 internally, so this is the spread of aggregates —
the true floor of what the gate compares. `fib.ts` (~400–437 ms vs 6–24 ms for the rest) drives
almost all of it. Recommendation, accepted: the 20% gate stands (2.7× headroom over the worst
spread seen); tightening toward 10% would leave ~1.3× headroom with no multi-host data, and
same-host consecutive comparison cancels most host bias by construction. Still open, narrowed:
these five runs are THIS host, not the weekly-job machine the residue names — that confirmation
is the remaining half of the Check. Tracked files (`baseline.json`, `README.md`) backed up and
byte-restored; git-ignored results deleted.

## 245. The program cache keyed on (path, mtime): stale-hit audit + content-hash fix (2026-09-14)

**Plan:** §9 Task 6.9 (landed below). `plan.md` edited in this change.

Audit (subagent, read-only): `createProgram` served the cached triple (program + diagnostics +
symbols) on (absolute path, mode, entry mtimeMs). test262 is the only reuser — thousands of
tests through slot-keyed `.tmp/test-<pid>-<slot>.js` paths — so a repeated (path, mtime) with
different bytes serves a stale program under the wrong test's name: silent conformance
corruption. Not live on APFS/ext4/NTFS (inter-write gaps ~400 ms vs ns–100 ns granularity, plus
single-entry eviction under concurrency; hit rate there is ~zero by the same token), but
concrete on serial runs over coarse-tick filesystems (FAT32 2 s), and `clearProgramCache` has
zero call sites. Subset/golden are safe by unique stable paths, differential/leak by process
isolation. Fix landed: key on entry sha256 (one small read, noise vs ~380 ms frontend);
`statSync` import gone with the mtime it served. The admitted dependency-hole (dep edit without
entry touch) stays as documented. Lesson for T10.3: hash-keying stays correct under any
scheduling; timestamp-keying does not.

While verifying nearby: the differential runner reports DIVERGENCE on a 5 s timeout without
re-checking after minimization — one load-induced false positive observed (identical
node/stator outputs, 70 further cases 0 divergences). Runner honesty wart, not a compiler bug;
not fixed here.

## 244. `test:asan` anatomy: the runtime rebuild is 0.5 s — the duplicate golden pass is the cost (2026-09-14)

**Plan:** §9 Task 6.8 (owner decision on the rerun policy). `plan.md` edited in this change.

"Cache the runtime, rebuild only on change" needs no new mechanism — it already exists: the
justfile compiles per object behind `stale()` (mtime + `-MMD` header deps) with a `cflags.txt`
toolchain/flag key that wipes objects on change. Measured, no-change tree: `just runtime` 0.5 s,
`just runtime-asan` 0.5 s (the `rm -f` + `ar rcs` from note 243 is inside that half second).
`runtime-test-asan` is 7.0 s including its rebuild. Per-fixture ASan cost is at parity with
release (8-fixture serial sample: 6.86 s asan vs 6.95 s release — the ~380 ms in-process frontend
dominates; the sanitizer adds nothing at this TU size; binaries verified truly sanitized: 71 KB
vs 1049 KB with `libclang_rt.asan`). So a full `test:asan` is ~0.5 s rebuild + ~7 s corpus +
~45–70 s golden rerun — the duplicate PASS is >85% of the cost, and no runtime-cache work can
move it. Task 6.8 owns the policy choice (content-hash skip vs nightly); the `rm -f` hardening
from 243 is proven safe by the same runs (clean archives, zero duplicate-symbol warnings,
`arrays.ts` byte-exact under both flavors, full golden-asan 212/212).

## 243. Stale `jsrt_zig.o` haunted both runtime archives; archives are now recreated (2026-09-14)

**Plan:** no task — drive-by fix below task size (one recipe line + comment); `plan.md` untouched.

`packages/runtime/build/libjsrt.a` and `build-asan/` both carried a `jsrt_zig.o` member (32 text
symbols, defining `T _jsrt_array_new`) with no corresponding object in `build/` and no Zig
anywhere in the main tree or the justfile — dropped in by a past experiment. The recipe archived
with `ar rcs` over an explicit object list, and `ar r` replaces matches but never deletes
members, so the ghost survived every incremental rebuild and duplicated `_jsrt_array_new`
archive-wide: an `ld: duplicate symbol` warning on EVERY link, with the linker silently picking
one definition. Golden suites stayed green, so this was noise plus a landmine, not a live
miscompile. Fix: the recipe `rm -f`s the archive before `ar rcs` (comment states the invariant:
membership is exactly the object list), then both archives were rebuilt from clean — 27 members,
no zig, zero duplicate-symbol warnings on release and ASan links, `arrays.ts` output byte-exact
under both. `build-intl/` was already clean and was not touched.

## 242. In-process runners land, and expose a cross-program lowering leak (2026-09-14)

**Plan:** §9 Tasks 6.6, 6.7. `plan.md` edited in this change (both struck, evidence in `done.md`).

**6.6 numbers** (same host as 241; wall times from the landing runs): subset 372 fixtures
351/21/0 in **10.6 s** (spawned baseline ~21 s — ~2×); golden 212/212 in **41.6 s** (v3.10 spawned
baseline 44.5 s on an older tree — the spawn saving is real but clang now dominates the share).
`test262/run.ts`'s in-process pattern transferred without new machinery; `parallel.ts` untouched.

**The leak the transport exposed.** First in-process golden run: 211/212 — `js/block_scope.js`
failed with a spurious `STA4020` on `inner += 1`, deterministic, only when compiled in the same
process AFTER `golden/js/named_function_expression.js` (`const f = function inner() ...`).
Root cause: `immutableSelfBindings` (`packages/compiler/src/lower/index.ts`) was never reset
between `lowerProgram` calls (unlike `functionNesting`/`moduleAwaits` beside it), so HIR's
name-only identifier resolution saw a ghost self-binding from the earlier program. Spawn-per-
fixture masked it with a fresh module per process. Fix in the same change: `lowerProgram` now
also clears `immutableSelfBindings` and resets `bindTempId` plus scope.ts's `shadowCounter` (new
`resetShadowCounter()` export) — the counters only rename temps, but the reset restores exact
fresh-process parity (same input → same HIR names → same C). Grep confirmed no other module-level
`let` in `lower/` (operator tables are `const`), none in `passes/` or `codegen/`, and
`frontend/program.ts`'s cache is keyed by entry+mode+mtime with a `clearProgramCache` escape —
no cross-fixture poisoning there. Standing lesson for future in-process paths (T10.3 host
parallelism especially): **module-level mutable lowering state is a latent cross-program bug**;
any new `let` at module scope in the pipeline needs a reset beside these three or a comment
saying why it survives reuse.

**Two observations, not fixed.** (1) Raw clang `ld: duplicate symbol '_jsrt_array_new'`
(`jsrt_value.o` vs `jsrt_zig.o` in the current `libjsrt.a`) now prints to the terminal — the old
runner captured and discarded it per fixture. Links succeed; the archive was not rebuilt here
(shared artifact, T9.1's tree). (2) `process.env['TZ'] = 'UTC'` is now set in the golden runner
process itself, since in-process `build()` reads the environment directly instead of inheriting
`PINNED_ENV` through a spawn — same pin, one layer up.

**6.7 numbers:** `cli.test.ts` converted to async `execa` (mechanical) with `Promise.all` overlap
in exactly the 3 tests issuing independent spawns (missing-entry build+explain, ts+js provenance
explains, STA1002 explain+build); 4 build-then-run tests stay ordered (binary must exist first),
each noted inline. No pool: max introduced concurrency is 2, a semaphore would be review surface
without scheduling benefit — recorded here as the reason Step's pool clause was not built.
`node --test cli.test.ts` 16/16 in **8.9 s** on a quiet box (11.4 s pre-change baseline from 241,
measured under different load — directionally better, not a controlled A/B; the overlap itself
saves ~2–3 spawn latencies ≈ 0.5–1 s). Spread under contention (7.6 → 30 s with a parallel clang
storm on the box) is load, not structure — `node:test` still runs the 16 tests sequentially, so
further wins need cross-test parallelism, not intra-test overlap.

## 241. Test-speed research: Bun vs Node, and where the wall time goes (2026-09-14)

Host: Darwin arm64, 16 cores, Node v26.8.2 via mise (pinned major 26; bare `node` on PATH is v24.20.0 — `mise exec node --` used throughout), Bun 1.3.14, warm FS cache. Full suites were NOT run repeatedly; subset ran whole once, everything else is 1–12-fixture/file samples.

Measurements: single `explain` Node ~350 ms vs Bun ~270 ms (Bun saves ~80 ms startup per spawn); `test:subset` full (372 fixtures) Node 20.9 s vs Bun 19.8 s (−5% — the checker dominates, not startup); `tests/unit/cli.test.ts` Node 11.4 s vs `bun test` 7.15 s (−37%, best case: serial sync spawns); `diagnostics.test.ts` Node 0.38 s vs Bun 0.40 s warm (cold Bun 1.4 s); `telemetry.test.ts` Node 1.9 s vs Bun 1.28 s (passes); golden fixture breakdown ~0.38 s emit-C (frontend: TS program + gate + lower + emit) + ~0.20 s clang + ~0.06 s exec + ~0.10 s Node oracle — frontend+clang ≈ 90% of a fixture; `clang -O0` vs `-O2` identical (204 vs 201 ms) so `STATOR_OPT=0` does not buy link speed; `tsc --noEmit` ×2 = 12.5 s; `--experimental-test-coverage` = 3.4x (`passes.test.ts` 1.3 → 4.4 s); lint ~2 s, dupes ~1 s, leak 1.6 s, builtins dashboard instant.

Bun compatibility blockers (why it is not adopted): (a) eight sites use `process.execPath` as BOTH compiler host and Node oracle — under Bun the golden/differential/leak ground truth silently becomes Bun, not the pinned Node (§6 Task 6.2a's whole point); (b) `scripts/check-node.mjs` fails under Bun (`v24.3.0` vs pin 26) and bypassing it removes the guardrail; (c) the lcov pipeline uses Node-only `--experimental-test-coverage` flags; `bun --test <file>` does not run `node:test` files (`bun test` does, with different flags/reporters); (d) Bun transpiles non-erasable syntax Node type-stripping refuses, weakening the `erasableSyntaxOnly` runtime guard. Works under Bun today: `execaSync`, ink/react CLI output, dotenv+OTel (`cli` 16/16, `telemetry` 3/3 under `bun test`).

Decisions: Bun rejected as default runner (standing decision in §9); coverage leaves the local gate (Task 6.4 — the run has no threshold and CI keeps one lcov owner); oracle pinned explicitly (Task 6.5); spawn-per-fixture removed via the test262 in-process precedent (Task 6.6); `cli.test.ts` parallelized (Task 6.7).

## 240. Phase 10 — `std` like a systems library, OS threads ↔ async, parallel host compiler (2026-09-13)

**Plan:** §11b Phase 10 (T10.1–T10.3), Phase 7 out-of-scope Threads row, Language & library
boundaries, §14 effort, §15.1 exception, §16 v4.7. `plan.md` was edited in this change.

**Why.** The creator asked for (1) a low-level API like `std`, with an implementation sketch in
the plan, (2) programs that use threads and threads that interoperate with async code, and
(3) rewriting the compiler to use threads so compilation is faster.

**How to implement (settled in the card, docs before code).**

1. **`std` (T10.1).** Systems-style modules (`env` / `process` / `path` / `fs` / `time` / later
   `sync` / `thread`), first-party `jsrt_std_*` in the C runtime, typed `std/*` imports — **not** a
   Node compatibility layer and **not** user FFI (Phase 7). `docs/STD.md` lands before code
   (§15.6). Promise-flavored FS waits on T10.2 so async code does not block main by accident.

2. **Threads ↔ async (T10.2).** Shared-heap **OS threads** + `std/sync` + a **promise completion
   MPSC queue** drained by the same `jsrt_run_microtasks` path Task 4.6 already owns. Main never
   shares the drain with workers; workers post completions or `runOnMain` thunks. Rejected for
   v0: isolate-per-worker and green-thread M:N. Test262 `SharedArrayBuffer` / `Atomics` / `Worker`
   stay separate not-yets — native `std.thread` is the Stator API. This **reopens** Phase 7's
   "single-threaded runtime" caveat for Stator-spawned threads only; foreign C threads calling in
   remain undefined until 7.2 is updated.

3. **Parallel compiler (T10.3).** The compiler stays TypeScript (§15.4 / note 239). "Rewrite with
   threads" = `STATOR_COMPILE_JOBS` and a measured ladder: parallel **clang** first (often the
   wall-time hog on small graphs), then emit, then sharded lower/verify with **one Program per
   worker/process** because `typescript.Program` is not thread-safe. No new compiler language.

**Sequencing.** Creator-directed like Phase 9: not gated on Phase 8. T10.3 is host-only and can
start immediately. T10.2 wants threads-enabled Boehm (prefer after T9.1 GC glue is mergeable).
T10.1's non-thread modules do not wait on Zig.

**Not done in this change.** No `docs/STD.md` / `THREADS.md` yet, no runtime code, no compiler
pool — plan + notes only.

## 239. Language and library boundaries: what stays, what Zig is for, what may come later (2026-09-13)

**Plan:** Phase 9 / T9.1 (the card and the Language & library boundaries table), prime directive 5,
§2, §12, §13, §15.4. `plan.md` was edited in this change. This is a survey, not a new task list.

The creator asked where another language or library makes sense, now that the memory core is Zig.
The answer is narrow. The compiler, the emit path, and generated code do not move. Zig is T9.1
only. Everything else below is either already settled or a §12 / tripwire candidate — not a card
an agent may open on its own.

**Keep (settled / already chosen).**

| Piece | Choice | Why it stays |
|---|---|---|
| Compiler | TypeScript + the `typescript` API in-process | §0.3 / §15.4. Do not rewrite the compiler in another language. |
| Emit | C; link clang + `libjsrt.a` | §0.4. A direct LLVM backend is §12 rung 6, after a measurement. |
| Generated code | C only | `jsrt_value.h` is the codegen↔runtime contract. Zig does not emit, and generated C is never hand-edited. |
| Rust | nowhere | Measured and rejected (dyn-dispatch, DSTs, `Rc<RefCell>`, borrow-check on megafiles). Still settled after 238. |
| Vendored | QuickJS-NG libregexp / libunicode, fdlibm | Golden rule 5. One RegExp engine. |
| Optional native | Boehm; ICU (intl build) | Already the default/optional split. |
| CLI-only | ink/react, dotenv; OTel opt-in | plan-notes 187. Must not leak below `src/cli/` (except `src/support/telemetry.ts`). |

**Zig (T9.1 only).** Memory core: GC glue, allocation helpers, shape tables, growable buffers in
print/JSON. Same C ABI into `libjsrt.a`. Boehm stays; Zig calls it through the C ABI. Do **not**
grow Zig into builtins, math, regexp, or codegen without a new plan task. Spreading Zig because
"we already have a Zig compiler" is exactly the drift 238 was written to prevent.

**Libraries worth considering later — not tasks yet.** They ride §12 or a named tripwire.

| Candidate | Gate |
|---|---|
| Ryū C vendor | §12 ladder. Already scheduled (notes 188, 190). Number print; corpus already matches Node. |
| mimalloc / jemalloc | §12 rung 1. Non-GC sites and the post-precise-GC backing allocator — not a global `malloc` interposition under Boehm. |
| simdutf (or similar) | Only if UTF-16 ops profile hot on Task 6.3's harness. |
| oxc-parser via napi | Only if the `typescript` tripwire in §13 fires (checking >30% of wall or OOM on 100k lines). Measured 2026-09-01: not tripped. |
| LLVM `.ll` emit / LTO+PGO | §12 rung 6. Measure `-O3` / LTO / PGO on the existing C path first; a new backend is not the cheapest rung. |
| QuickJS-NG full interpreter | Phase 8, already planned. Same commit as the vendored libregexp — a second copy is duplicate symbols. |

**Do not.**

- Rewrite the compiler in another language.
- Adopt MMTk or any Rust GC without reopening §15.4 with measured evidence. Evaluating MMTk is
  fine; adopting it is not a preference.
- Add a second RegExp engine beside libregexp.
- Spread Zig beyond the memory core without a new card.

**Open for the creator:** `mlugg/setup-zig@v2` as a CI dependency (noted in 238). Windows never
builds the runtime, so that job would skip the action.

## 238. The runtime's memory core moves to Zig; the C11-only runtime is reopened on the creator's direction (2026-09-13)

**Plan:** §15.4 (Agent execution protocol item 4: "C11 runtime" among the settled decisions), prime
directive 5, the §2 pipeline sketch, and T9.1. `plan.md` was edited in this change.

**Home of the Zig sources.** The move this entry describes lives in `.worktrees/t9-1` (branch
`agent/t9-1`) until a follow-up PR. Main records the decision and the T9.1 card; it does not
contain `src/*.zig` yet.

**Why reopened.** §15.4 reopens a settled decision only with new measured evidence. This one was
reopened because the creator directed it (T9.1), and this entry records it as that direction, not
as evidence. Still settled: generated code is C, `jsrt_value.h` is the codegen↔runtime contract,
Boehm is the collector, and Rust stays out.

**What moved.** The C ABI is unchanged. Every symbol Zig defines is declared in `jsrt.h`,
`jsrt_value.h` or the new internal `src/jsrt_mem.h`.

- `jsrt_gc.c` → `jsrt_gc.zig` (the C file is deleted): the unboxing mark procedure, the chained
  root push, `jsrt_gc_init`/`jsrt_gc_alloc`, and the malloc fallback.
- The print and JSON growable buffers → `jsrt_buf.zig`: `JSRTBuf`, `JSRTStrVec` (console.table)
  and `JSRTUnitBuf` (JSON.parse). The string ops have no growable buffer (each string is allocated
  at its exact size), so nothing there moved.
- The shape table → `jsrt_shape.zig`: the root, the chain walk, transitions, slot growth,
  enumeration order and the delete replay. The property semantics built on it (inline caches,
  accessors, TypeErrors, `jsrt_shape_key`) stay in `jsrt_shape.c`.
- The allocation helpers `jsrt_value.h` declares → `jsrt_alloc.zig`: `jsrt_object_new`,
  `jsrt_array_new` and its growth, `jsrt_env_new/clone/copy_slots`, `jsrt_closure_new`,
  `jsrt_args_rest`, `jsrt_dynobj_new`, `jsrt_null_proto_new` and `jsrt_dynobj_new_class`.
  Builtin-specific constructors (Map, Date, strings, promises, …) stay with their builtins.

**Layouts.** Zig `@cImport`s the headers, so no struct is mirrored. There is one workaround: Zig
0.16's translate-c derives a `slots` method from `jsrt_env_copy_slots` that collides with
`JSRTEnv`'s flexible `slots` member, so the import renames that one declaration with `@cDefine`.

**Build.**
- The justfile builds one object, `jsrt_zig.o`, from `src/jsrt_mem.zig` and archives it with the C
  objects in every flavor.
- It passes Zig the C objects' own `-I`/`-D` flags; that is how `-DJSRT_HAVE_BOEHM` reaches the
  `@cImport`.
- Optimization is `ReleaseFast` for rel and intl and `ReleaseSafe` for asan. Zig code cannot be
  ASan-instrumented, so its safety checks stand in, and a trap ends in `jsrt_panic`.
- It also passes `-fPIC -mcpu=baseline` and, on macOS, clang's deployment target. Without that
  target every program link warned that the object was built for macOS 26.6.2 while linking 26.0.
- `zig fmt --check` is the style gate. Zig has no warnings, only errors, which is the `-Werror`
  equivalent.
- The archive is now rebuilt from scratch. `ar rcs` kept a stale `jsrt_gc.o` member beside the new
  definitions of its symbols.

**Toolchain.**
- zig 0.16.0 is pinned in `mise.toml` (creator-approved; the global 0.14.1 is untouched) and listed
  in `docs/TOOLCHAIN.md`.
- CI installs it through `mlugg/setup-zig@v2` in the shared setup action. Windows skips that step
  because it never builds the runtime. The action is a new third-party CI dependency and awaits the
  creator's approval.

**Measured** (arm64 macOS, zig 0.16.0, conda clang 21.1.8, Boehm 8.2.12, Node 26.7.0). The results
are the same as the untouched tree's, before and after the move, in the worktree:

```
runtime: print corpus matches Node
runtime: print corpus matches Node (ASan/UBSan)
golden: 240 fixtures — 240 passed, 0 failed          // plain and STATOR_RUNTIME=asan
subset: 434 fixtures — 413 passed, 21 expected-fail, 0 failed
unit: tests 392, pass 392, fail 0
leak: 10M objects — peak RSS 3024 KB of a 65536 KB cap, 33 samples, plateau
```

## 232. Method-value rewrite/emit must keep array-op args and evaluate the receiver (2026-09-12)

**Plan:** §8 step 12(e) method values. **Evidence:** grouping `method-value` with `array-op` /
`method-call` in `rewrite.ts` dropped argument walking — `MethodValue` has no `args`, so the
shared arm only rewrote `target`. DCE's reachability walk uses that walker, so a function used
only as `xs.filter(isBig)` was shaken out and the leftover identifier became STA4002
(`array_callbacks.ts`). Direct `method-value` emit also skipped `expr.target`, so `new C().m`
never constructed `C` and left an unwritten global slot (`frames.test.ts`). **Decision:** walk
`array-op`/`method-call` args again; evaluate the receiver for side effects on a direct method
value (comma when the target is an expression, flushed lines when it is `new`). **plan.md edited:**
no — both surfaces were already struck through; this is a landing bugfix.

## 231. Named function expression self-binding is lowering + emitter, not a new closure kind

**Plan:** §8 step 12(e) named the construct unblocked once the function's own identifier binds
inside its body only. **Evidence:** `lowerFunction` already set `FunctionExpr.name` from the source
but `gateFunction` refused the spelling; no slot existed for the inner name. **Decision:**
`FunctionExpr.selfBinding` holds the HIR name from `inner.declare`; codegen counts the slot and
initialises it at function entry with the same `closureValue` the expression uses (static closure
for non-capturing functions — sufficient for the recursion golden). Assignment to the inner name
lowers to a `type-error` node; the TypeScript checker also rejects it (`STA0012`), which is stricter
than Node's runtime `TypeError` but matches ESM/strict. **plan.md edited:** yes — struck named
function expressions from the step-12(e) open list.

## 230. Method values landed: `has_receiver` on `JSRTClosure` and `jsrt_call` shifts (2026-09-12)

**Measured — pinned Node 26.7.0**, two-parameter method `add(a, b)`:

```
3          // o.add(1, 2)
3          // const g = o.add; g(1, 2)
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'x')   // g() when body reads this.x
```

**Measured — this compiler after the landing**, `stator build method_value.ts --emit=c`:

```c
static const JSRTClosure _jsrt_closure_0 = {_jsrt_fn_0, 2, "add", NULL, true};
...
jsrt_call(jsrt_closure(&_jsrt_closure_0), 2, &slot);  // g(1, 2): arity 2, has_receiver true
```

`g.length` would read `closure.arity` (2), not 3. Class field call (`new Runner().run(41)`) lowers
through field-access + ordinary `call` and needed only the `gateCall` refusal removed.

**plan.md edited:** yes — §8 step 12(e) strikes method values and calling a class field; class-as-value,
`super` as a value stay open; named function expressions landed as 231.

## 229. Step 12c computed keys on object literals (2026-09-12)

**Surface:** `{ [key]: v }` on object literals in both modes. Non-fixed-shape spread stays
`STA1214`; methods landed as 228.

**Representation:** one new HIR member, `ComputedEntry { key, value }`, emitted with
`jsrt_dyn_index_set` — no second object representation. Static string-literal computed keys reuse the
layout path; runtime keys and integer indices (`{ [0]: 1 }`) go dynamic so `console.log` order
matches Node (indices first).

**Gate collateral:** `IndexSignature` in a type annotation (`{ [k: string]: n }`) must be accepted
at the walk — it is checker metadata, not a runtime construct — or the TS dynamic-keys subset fixture
failed with STA1214 on the annotation before the literal was reached.

```text
golden: 199 fixtures — 199 passed, 0 failed
subset: 364 fixtures — 341 passed, 23 expected-fail, 0 failed
unit 386; pass 386; fail 0
```

## 228. Object-literal method members use the class method table (2026-09-12)

`{ m() { … } }` is not dynamic and not a slot: `isDynamicShape` still answers `false` for methods
(the trigger list is accessor/optional/index/empty only), and `shapeTypeToHType` now splits data
fields from method members the way `classTypeToHType` does. Lowering adds `ObjectLiteral.methods`;
codegen's `registerShape` copies them onto the per-literal `JSRTClass` descriptor; `declaringClassName`
and the gate accept `o.m()` on a shape-typed receiver by naming the structural descriptor. Method-as-
value stays `STA1214` — no receiver shift in `jsrt_call` yet (notes 210). Evidence: golden
`object_literal_method.{ts,js}`, subset `subset_object_literal_method_{ts,js}`.

## 227. Array-literal spread (Phase 5 step 12, 2026-09-12)

**Evidence:** `subset_spread_operator_array_{ts,js}` pass; golden `array_spread.{ts,js}` byte-match Node; gate accepts array/tuple spread, refuses holes/string/non-array iterables.

**Decision:** Lower `[lit, ...arr, lit]` to nested `array-op concat` segments — no new HIR node, reuses `jsrt_array_concat`. SUBSET.md row updated; `plan.md` had no separate Check for this construct.

## 2026-08-29 — Phase 1 Task 1.0 bootstrap

### 1. npm package name `stator` is taken → package `statorc`, binary stays `stator`
**Plan:** §4 Task 1.0 step 3 anticipated exactly this. **Evidence:** `npm view stator` returns
`name = 'stator'`, `version = '0.1.0'` (an unrelated package). `npm view statorc` → 404.
**Decision:** `package.json` `"name": "statorc"`, `"bin": {"stator": "dist/cli/main.js"}`.
The user-facing binary is unaffected. A unit test (`tests/unit/cli.test.ts`) pins both, so the
binary name cannot drift silently. **plan.md edited:** no — the plan already prescribed this.

### 2. TypeScript `latest` is now 7.0.2 (tsgo) — pinned 6.0.3 instead
**Plan:** §0.3 and §4 Task 1.0 step 4 ban TypeScript 7 / tsgo (its public compiler API is
incomplete). **Evidence:** `npm view typescript dist-tags` → `latest: 7.0.2`, `rc: 7.0.1-rc`,
`beta: 6.0.0-beta`. Newest stable 6.x is `6.0.3`. **Decision:** pin `typescript@6.0.3` exactly.
**Re-evaluate quarterly** (next: 2026-11-29) — the question is not whether 7.x is *stable* but
whether its public compiler API (`createProgram`, `getTypeChecker`, and the AST surface we
lower from) is complete and documented. **plan.md edited:** no — pin is inside the plan's rule.

### 3. The locked `tsconfig.json` needed two more flags to work at all
**Plan:** §4 Task 1.0 step 5 declares the `compilerOptions` block "load-bearing and locked".
**Problem:** as written it cannot both (a) run under Node's native type stripping in dev and
(b) emit runnable JS via `npm run build`. Node resolves relative imports literally, so source
must write `import { x } from './build.ts'` — which plain `nodenext` rejects.
**Fix:** added `"allowImportingTsExtensions": true` (lets source use real `.ts` specifiers) and
`"rewriteRelativeImportExtensions": true` (rewrites them to `.js` on emit, so `dist/` runs).
Both are additive; nothing was weakened — every strictness flag in the locked block is intact.
**plan.md edited:** yes — §4 Task 1.0 step 5's block now contains the two flags.

### 4. A second tsconfig for `tests/`
**Plan:** the locked `tsconfig.json` sets `rootDir: "src"`, `include: ["src"]` — so nothing
under `tests/` is type-checked, and ESLint's `projectService` reports
"was not found by the project service" for every test file.
**Fix:** added `tests/tsconfig.json` extending the locked one (`noEmit`, `rootDir: "."`,
`include: ["**/*.ts"]`, excluding the deliberately-invalid fixture directories
`subset/subset_*`, `golden/ts`, `golden/js`, `differential`). `npm run typecheck` runs both
projects. The locked config is untouched and still governs `src/`.
**plan.md edited:** yes — §4 Task 1.0 step 5 now mentions the tests project.

### 5. `node --test tests/unit/` does not work on Node 26
**Plan:** §4 Task 1.0 step 9 specifies that exact script. **Evidence:** Node 26.7.0 treats the
directory argument as a module to load: `Error: Cannot find module '.../tests/unit'`.
**Fix:** `node --test "tests/unit/*.test.ts"` (glob form). Verified: 6 tests pass.
**plan.md edited:** yes — §4 Task 1.0 step 9.

### 6. `CC ?= clang` in the runtime Makefile silently used `cc`
**Evidence:** first `make -C runtime` compiled with `cc`, not `clang` — make's *built-in*
default for `CC` is already defined, so `?=` never fires. **Fix:** override only the built-in
default, so an explicitly-set `CC` from the environment still wins:
`ifeq ($(origin CC),default)` / `CC := clang` / `endif`. **plan.md edited:** no — an
implementation detail below the plan's granularity.

### 7. Sanitized runtime builds to `build-asan/`, not `build/`
**Plan:** §4 Task 1.0 step 8 says `make -C runtime asan` "adds" sanitizer flags but does not
say where the archive lands. **Decision:** separate output directories (`build/libjsrt.a`,
`build-asan/libjsrt.a`) so a sanitized archive can never be linked into a release binary
because of a stale object file. **plan.md edited:** no — additive detail, recorded here.

### 8. `void test(...)` in unit tests
`node:test`'s `test()` returns a promise the runner owns; `typescript-eslint`'s
`no-floating-promises` flags every call. Marked with the `void` operator — the escape the rule
itself sanctions — with a comment saying why. No lint rule was disabled (AGENTS.md forbids it).

### 9. Node pin is 26.7.0 — ~~OPEN QUESTION for the owner~~ RESOLVED 2026-09-04
`.node-version` is pinned to the host's `26.7.0`, satisfying the plan's `>= 24`. But plan §4
Task 1.0 step 2 says "current Node **LTS**", and 26.x may still be Current rather than LTS.
Since this pin is the differential-testing ground truth for the life of the project, the owner
should confirm: stay on 26.7.0, or drop to the active 24.x LTS line. ~~**Unresolved.**~~
**Resolved 2026-09-04 (entry 190): stay on 26.7.0.** It has been the ground truth since
2026-08-29 and three artefacts are measured against it — 146 golden fixtures, the Test262
ratchet, and `tests/bench/baseline.json`. Node 26 enters LTS this October; moving to 24.x would
re-baseline all three to satisfy a word for six weeks. plan.md §4 records the answer in place of
the follow-up.

---

## 2026-08-29 — Phase 1 Tasks 1.1–1.3 (the three spec documents)

### 10. Diagnostic-code collisions between `docs/SUBSET.md` and `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md`
**Plan:** §4 Task 1.3 names `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md` as the full code table, so it is the
authoritative allocator. **Problem:** the matrix (Task 1.1) and the code table (Task 1.3) were
written concurrently and each allocated from the same ranges, so six codes ended up with two
different meanings, and three more were duplicates of codes the table had already assigned.
**Decision:** `DIAGNOSTICS.md` wins every collision; `SUBSET.md` was remapped:

| Was (SUBSET) | Now | Because `DIAGNOSTICS.md` already used the old number for |
|---|---|---|
| STA1110 Proxy (ts) | STA1106 | CommonJS `require()` |
| STA1111 prototype mutation (ts) | STA1107 | `.tsx`/`.jsx` |
| STA1112 `delete` class field (ts) | STA1108 | — (moved to keep the ts trio contiguous) |
| STA1203 `new Function` (js) | STA1206 | Proxy (js), Phase 8 |
| STA1204 dynamic `import()` | STA1207 | prototype mutation (js), Phase 8 |
| STA1205 top-level `await` | STA1208 | `delete` class field (js), Phase 8 |
| STA1214/1215/1216 Proxy / proto / delete (js) | STA1203/1204/1205 | duplicates of existing rows |

`SUBSET.md`-only features that had no row in the table got one: `STA1207`, `STA1208`,
`STA1210`–`STA1213`, plus `STA2001` (the boundary check, which both `MODES.md` and `SUBSET.md`
referenced but nothing had allocated). `STA1209` is deliberately left unallocated.
**plan.md edited:** no — the plan delegates the full table to `DIAGNOSTICS.md`; only the
`STA1102` change below touched it.

### 11. `STA1102` retired — a "not yet" code inside the "never" range
**Plan:** §1.3 requires that "never" codes and "not yet" codes occupy **disjoint ranges so tests
can tell intent from schedule**. `STA1102` was allocated for eval/`new Function` in `js` mode —
a *deferral* (Phase 8) — but sits in `STA11xx`, the permanent-rejection range. A test asserting
"this is rejected by design" could not be distinguished from one asserting "this ships later".
**Fix:** renumbered globally to `STA1206` across `plan.md`, `docs/MODES.md`,
`docs/SUBSET.md`, `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md`. `STA1102` is listed in a new "Retired codes" table in
`DIAGNOSTICS.md` and must never be reused. This is only possible because nothing has shipped;
after v1, the fix for a misfiled code is to add a correct one, never to move it.
**plan.md edited:** yes — §1.2's `eval`/`new Function` reference now reads `STA1206`.

### 12. `stator explain --json` emits both a per-construct array and a file-level rollup
**Plan:** §1.3 and `AGENTS.md` promise *per-construct* verdicts; `tests/subset/run.ts` (§4 Task
1.4) reads a *single* top-level verdict. Item 3 of the "Open items" list flagged these as
contradictory. **Decision:** they are not exclusive — emit both. `constructs` is the primary
artifact (dropping it would remove the only thing `explain` exists for: locating *which*
construct went dynamic). The top-level `verdict`/`code` is derived from it by severity
`error > not-yet > dynamic > static`, with `code` taken from the first construct in source order
carrying the winning verdict, and **omitted, never `null`**, when the rollup is `static` or
`dynamic`. Because each decision-test fixture isolates one construct, the rollup is exactly that
construct's verdict — so `tests/subset/run.ts` needed **no change**. Schema and two worked
examples are in `docs/MODES.md` §6. **plan.md edited:** no — the resolution satisfies both
§1.3 and the Task 1.4 runner as written.

### 13. Four contradictions found in `docs/MODES.md` while reconciling
Each was fixed in favor of the authoritative document, not the more recent one.
1. **Column indexing.** `MODES.md` claimed "0-indexed columns; matches editors and `grep -n`";
   `DIAGNOSTICS.md` specifies 1-indexed. `DIAGNOSTICS.md` is right on both counts (`tsc` and
   `clang` are 1-indexed; `grep -n` reports no column at all). All `MODES.md` examples shifted.
2. **Six constructs sharing `STA1101`.** `MODES.md` §2 gave `Proxy`, prototype mutation, `var`,
   `arguments`, and `new Function` the same code as `eval`, which would make a test unable to
   assert *why* a file was rejected. Split to the codes the table already allocated.
3. **`Symbol` listed as permanently rejected.** It is `STA1212`, Phase 5 — a deferral. Nothing
   outside plan §1.1's closed list may be called permanent, and `Symbol.iterator` especially
   cannot be, since `for`…`of` over a typed iterable is a supported static construct.
4. **`STA2001` described as a compile-time error.** A boundary check fails at *runtime* by
   definition — the boundary exists because the type is unknowable statically (plan §0.2). The
   static guarantee is that the check is emitted, not that it passes. `DIAGNOSTICS.md` now
   carries a `runtime` diagnostic class for exactly this one code.

Also corrected in passing: `MODES.md` used `process` as an example function name in a document
that elsewhere states there is no `process` global, and the example then read `process.env` —
which in real JS resolves to the local function, not Node's global. Renamed.

### 14. The subset runner now validates `@code` against `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md`
**Plan:** §4 Task 1.4 step 2 says expected-fail fixtures are counted, not executed. **Gap that
creates:** an expected-fail fixture is the *only* kind nothing looks at, so a `// @code:` naming
a code that was never allocated — or one that was retired, like `STA1102` — would sit unnoticed
until the phase that implements the feature, which is years away for the Phase-8 rows. Since
the whole corpus lands expected-fail, that is the entire corpus.
**Fix:** `tests/subset/run.ts` parses the allocated codes out of `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md` (stopping
at the "Retired codes" heading, so retired codes correctly fail) and checks every fixture's
`@code`, expected-fail included. Directive parsing already ran on every fixture; this rides
along with it. **plan.md edited:** no — Task 1.4 step 1 already charges the runner with parsing
directives and asserting codes; this closes the case the step did not anticipate.

### 15. `STA1112` allocated for decorators
`docs/SUBSET.md`'s "Out of scope for v1" section listed decorators as `error` with **no code**,
which Task 1.4 cannot express — the runner requires `@code` for an `error` verdict. Allocated
`STA1112` in the `never` range, not `not-yet`: decorators are a plan §0 non-goal and no phase
promises them, so there is no phase name for a not-yet message to carry.

---

## 2026-08-29 — Phase 1 Task 1.4 (decision-test corpus)

### 16. Corpus written: 152 fixtures, 76 matrix rows × 2 modes
**Check met:** `docs/SUBSET.md` has 76 feature rows; `tests/subset/` holds 76 `_ts` and 76 `_js`
fixtures with identical slug sets, so every row has exactly one decision test per mode.
`npm run test:subset` reports `152 fixtures — 0 passed, 152 expected-fail, 0 failed`. Every one
carries `// @expected-fail: true`, which is correct and not a shortcut: `explain` does not exist
until Phase 2, so nothing here *can* pass yet. That count is the number to watch fall.

**Convention adopted for conditional verdicts.** Many rows read "static if typed, else dynamic".
A fixture must pin exactly one verdict, so: the `ts` fixture takes the *typed* branch (`static`)
— ts mode rejects untyped code, so the typed case is the only reachable one there — and the `js`
fixture takes the *untyped* branch (`dynamic`) with a deliberately untyped body. The two fixtures
together cover both branches of the row, and neither is ambiguous on its own. Rows whose feature
is TypeScript-only syntax (type annotations, interfaces, unions, `unknown`, generics) have a
`js`-mode fixture with a `.ts` extension, since `js` mode accepts `.ts` files and gives them the
full static treatment — which is exactly what those rows assert.

### 17. `docs/SUBSET.md` "Static methods and static class members" was under-specified
The `js` cell read "static (where typed)", which has a condition but no else-branch, so the
generated fixture claimed `static` for an untyped `.js` body — a verdict the row does not
actually support. **Fix:** the cell now reads "static if typed, else dynamic" like its siblings,
with a note distinguishing the two halves: a static *method* is always static (its identity is
fixed at compile time), while a static *field* follows its value, so an untyped one holds
`Unknown` and reads route through the dynamic path. Fixture corrected to `dynamic`.

### 18. `exclude` does not stop a file entering the program by import
**Symptom:** `npm run typecheck` failed on `tests/subset/subset_cyclic_imports_ts.ts`, a fixture
`tests/tsconfig.json` explicitly excludes. **Cause:** `exclude` only removes files from the
*root* set. The cyclic-import row needs a partner module to form a real cycle; that partner
(`cycle_partner_ts.ts`) was not excluded, so it was a root, and its `import` pulled the excluded
fixture back into the program — where `noUnusedLocals` promptly flagged it.
**Fix:** exclude the fixture support files by name (`subset/helper_*`, `subset/cycle_partner_*`)
in both `tests/tsconfig.json` and `eslint.config.js`. With no root reaching them, the fixtures
stay outside the program. `tests/subset/run.ts` is still checked, which is the point of having
the tests project at all. Worth remembering: for deliberately-invalid fixtures, *every* file that
imports them must be excluded too, not just the fixtures themselves.

### 19. ESLint + typescript-eslint replaced by Biome
**Touches:** plan §4 Task 1.0 steps 4/6/9, §15.4 rule 7, `docs/TOOLCHAIN.md`.
**Change:** two dev deps (`eslint` 10.9.1, `typescript-eslint` 8.68.0, ~130 transitive packages)
replaced by one (`@biomejs/biome` 2.5.11, a single Rust binary) that does lint *and* format.
`eslint.config.js` deleted, `biome.json` added. Net dev-dependency count goes down, so the
budget rule (AGENTS.md) is satisfied by subtraction, not exception. §15.4's "no Rust anywhere"
is a decision about what the *compiler* is written in; it does not bind dev tooling.
**Rule parity:** the four load-bearing rules all exist in Biome and are set to `error` —
`noExplicitAny`, `noNonNullAssertion`, `useExhaustiveSwitchCases` (nursery), `useImportType`.
The `types` domain gives Biome's own type inference, which is what `useExhaustiveSwitchCases`
and `noFloatingPromises` need; there is no `tsconfig` project service and no tsc invocation.
**Known gap:** `strictTypeChecked`'s full type-aware set has no Biome equivalent. In particular
`noUnnecessaryConditions` (Biome's `no-unnecessary-condition`) is **off**: Biome's inference does
not model `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, so it flagged the required `?.` in
`tests/subset/run.ts:45` (`match?.[1]?.trim()`) as unnecessary. Re-enable only if that changes.
`tsc --noEmit` under the locked strict config still carries most of that weight.
**Also:** `biome check` is format-checking too, so `npm run lint` now fails on unformatted
source; `npm run format` writes fixes. Warnings are escalated with `--error-on-warnings` because
Biome exits 0 on warning-level diagnostics by default. Entry 18's `eslint.config.js` fixture
excludes now live in `biome.json` under `files.includes` as `!`-prefixed patterns.
**Check:** `npm run lint` → `Checked 15 files in 137ms. No fixes applied.`, exit 0.

### 20. npm → pnpm, and `cpd` added as a duplication gate
**Touches:** plan §4 Task 1.0 steps 4/9/10, `docs/TOOLCHAIN.md`, `ci.sh`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
**Package manager:** pnpm 11.20.0, pinned by `packageManager` in `package.json` so Corepack and CI
agree without a second pin. `package-lock.json` deleted, `pnpm-lock.yaml` committed.
`npm ci` → `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` everywhere (`ci.sh`, the workflow, AGENTS.md, docs).
The workflow gains `pnpm/action-setup@v4` before `setup-node` and `cache: pnpm`.
Exact pinning is unchanged: pnpm was given `-E`, so every dep is still a bare version, not a range.
**Duplication:** `cpd` 5.0.16 (the Rust rewrite of jscpd; same repo, new package name) as a dev dep,
configured by `.jscpd.json` — `minTokens: 50`, `mode: strict`, `crossFormats: js-ts`, `threshold: 1`,
`reporters: ["ai"]`. The AI reporter is the compact `path start-end ~ start-end` form, chosen because
the console/HTML reporters print full clone bodies that no agent or reviewer needs.
`crossFormats: js-ts` matters here specifically: `tests/` holds a `.ts` and a `.js` spelling of the
same program for most rows, and cross-format detection strips type annotations before comparing.
**Ignores mirror `biome.json`:** the 152 `subset_*` fixtures and the golden/differential trees are
deliberate near-duplicates (each row exists twice, once per mode) — scanning them reports ~100%
duplication and hides everything real. `runtime/vendor/` is excluded for the same reason it is
never hand-edited.
**Gate:** `dupes` runs inside `pnpm run ci`, between `lint` and `test`, and fails above 1%
duplication. Current state is **3 clones, 0.4%** — all three are benign and left alone
(the two ci.yml job bodies, a repeated JSON block in `docs/MODES.md`, and the shared
spawn/report preamble of `tests/golden/run.ts` and `tests/subset/run.ts`). The threshold is a
ratchet against new duplication, not a demand to refactor these.
**Check:** `pnpm run ci` green end to end; `pnpm run dupes` → `3 clones · 0.4% duplication`, exit 0.

## 2026-08-29 — Phase 2 Task 2.1 (`docs/VALUE.md`, the value contract)

### 22. Phase 2 started with the Phase 0 gate still open — owner instruction, second time
**Plan:** §3 says the gate needs a human decision, and the §3 status block added at Phase 1 close
says explicitly that the gate and the initial commit must both land "before Phase 2 work starts".
**What happened:** the owner instructed "go next" with Phase 0 still open, which is the same
explicit-instruction exception Phase 1 already ran under. **What was NOT done:** no `NICHE.md`
was written and no `phase-0-approved` tag was created. An agent writing the niche justification
and then approving it is the exact failure the gate exists to prevent (plan §3 Task 0.1 step 4),
and "the owner said go" does not convert an agent-authored file into a human decision. The gate
stays open and stays the owner's. **plan.md edited:** no — the §3 status block is still accurate.

### 23. NaN canonicalization is mandatory, because the default NaN collides with `undefined`
**Decision recorded because it constrains every future emitter change.** The tag space is
*negative* quiet NaNs (mask `0xFFF8000000000000`). On x86-64, the SSE default NaN from `0.0/0.0`
is `0xFFF8000000000000` — bit-identical to `JSRT_UNDEFINED`. An arithmetic NaN reaching a value
slot unfiltered would therefore silently *become* `undefined`.
**Rule:** every double entering a `jsrt_value` goes through `jsrt_number()`, which replaces any
NaN with the canonical positive quiet NaN. Generated C never bit-casts a double into a value,
with no exception for literals the emitter believes cannot be NaN — the cost is one predictable
branch and the failure mode is silent corruption. Legal because ECMAScript exposes exactly one
NaN, so the substitution is unobservable.

### 24. `-0.0` drove the `Int32` demotion rule, which Phase 2 does not even use
`(double)(int32_t)(-0.0) == -0.0` is **true**, so the obvious "is it integral and in range" test
admits `-0.0` and would quietly demote it to `+0` — breaking `Object.is(-0, 0) === false` and
`1/-0 === -Infinity`, both of which plan §2 names as decision tests. `jsrt_fits_int32()` carries
an explicit `signbit` clause for this and exists as a named helper precisely so the check cannot
be re-derived incorrectly at a call site. Phase 2 emits no `Int32` at all (all numbers are f64
per plan §5); the tag and the rule are specified now so Phase 3 turning it on is a codegen change
with no layout change.

### 25. `console.log(-0)` prints `-0`, but `String(-0)` is `"0"` — two functions, not one
`Number::toString(-0)` is specified to return `"0"`. Node's `console.log` runs values through
`util.inspect`, which prints `-0` to keep the distinction visible. Golden tests compare
`console.log` output byte-for-byte, so `jsrt_print` implements the **inspect** rule and
`jsrt_to_string` implements the **spec** rule; both are declared in `jsrt_value.h`.
Recorded because the alternative is discovering it as a one-character golden diff and
misdiagnosing it as a Ryū bug.

Two adjacent number-formatting traps are documented in `docs/VALUE.md` §3.2 for the same reason:
the decimal/exponential threshold is **1e21**, far above what a C library's `%g` uses, and
negative exponents are written `1e-7` with **no zero padding**. `%g` gets both wrong.

### 26. `jsrt_strict_equals` is a function from day 1, though Phase 2's subset barely needs it
`===` is not `a == b` on the raw 64-bit value: `NaN !== NaN` despite the canonical NaNs being
bit-equal, and `+0 === -0` despite those being bit-unequal. Once Phase 3 emits `Int32`, a number
also has two representations. Writing the cheap version now and fixing it later would mean every
emitted comparison is wrong in two edge cases that golden tests would catch only by luck.

### 27. `HType` ships with six kinds, not the full model from plan §2
`src/hir/types.ts` implements the primitives plus first-class `Unknown`. The compound kinds
(`fn`, `array`, object-shape, map/set, union, generic-instance) and the `i32` refinement are
absent rather than stubbed: an unconstructed variant is a switch case every pass must carry and
no test can reach. They land with the Phase 3 ladder and `NUMERIC.md`.
`Unknown` carries a `fromImplicitAny` flag because the gate — and only the gate — needs to tell
"the user wrote nothing" from "the checker genuinely could not resolve this"; in `ts` mode the
first is an error and in `js` mode both are the dynamic path.

### 28. Ryū is not vendored; the shortest-round-trip search stands in for it
Task 2.5 says "vendored Ryū (`runtime/vendor/ryu/`) wired into number printing". Ryū was not
vendored: this environment has no network access to fetch it, and hand-transcribing a float
printer is exactly the mistake AGENTS.md rule 5 exists to prevent.

`shortest_digits()` in `runtime/src/jsrt_print.c` produces the same answer by a different route:
for p = 0..17 it formats with `%.{p}e` and keeps the first p whose `strtod` round-trips. Searching
over *significant* digits means the first success is the minimal digit count, which is precisely
what ECMA-262 `Number::toString` step 5 asks for. It is correct and slow — up to 18
snprintf+strtod pairs per number printed.

Evidence that it is correct: `make -C runtime test` diffs a 45-line corpus of hostile doubles
(1e20, 1e21, 0.1+0.2, 5e-324, ±0, the int32 boundaries) against `console.log` on the pinned Node
and passes byte-for-byte, clean and under ASan/UBSan.

The swap is contained on purpose. Ryū replaces the body of `shortest_digits()` alone — its
`(digits, k, n)` contract and every caller stay as they are — so vendoring later is a
one-function change, not a rewrite. Plan text updated to say so.

### 29. Boehm GC is not installed here, so the runtime is the documented malloc fallback
`pkg-config --cflags bdw-gc` finds nothing on this machine. `runtime/Makefile` already had the
fallback branch; both `make -C runtime` and `make -C runtime asan` build and report which one
they took. Nothing in Phase 2 frees memory, so no collection is not yet observable.

Found while checking it: the `CFLAGS_COMMON += -DJSRT_HAVE_BOEHM` line sat *below* the
`CFLAGS_REL := $(CFLAGS_COMMON) -O2` assignment. `:=` expands immediately, so on a machine that
*does* have bdw-gc the define would have been dropped and the build would have used plain malloc
while printing "Runtime built with: Boehm GC". Fixed by moving detection above the assignments.
The bug was invisible here precisely because the fallback is the branch we take.

### 30. The gate accepted eight constructs the HIR cannot represent
The first version of `gateConstruct` accepted `&&`/`||`, `+=`/`-=`, `==`/`!=`, unary `+ - !`, any
call expression, and any property access. `src/hir/nodes.ts` has no node for any of them, so each
would have passed the gate and then hit an `STA4xxx` internal error in the lowering — the compiler
reporting its own bug for source it had just chosen to accept. Two more were worse: every node
kind not on the accept list fell through to a catch-all, which meant the `NumberKeyword` inside
`let x: number = 1` was rejected as an unsupported construct, and `.d.ts` files were walked as if
they were programs.

`gateConstruct` was rewritten so its accept set equals the HIR's vocabulary exactly, with that
invariant stated at the top of the function. Type nodes and declaration files are now skipped
before gating rather than gated and rejected.

The general rule this produced: **widening the HIR and widening the gate are the same change.**
A construct the gate accepts that the lowering cannot lower is not a missing feature, it is a
disagreement about the subset, and it always surfaces as an internal error.

### 31. Four separate STA collisions, from four modules allocating their own codes
The lowering allocated `STA4000`–`STA4007`, the verifier `STA4001`–`STA4019`, the CLI already had
`STA4001`, and the gate invented `STA1214`–`STA1218` and `STA1299` as placeholders. So `STA4001`
had three meanings and `STA4002`–`STA4007` two each.

Resolved by allocating properly in `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md` (the sole allocator): verifier
`STA4002`–`STA4020`, lowering `STA4030`–`STA4037`, `STA4021` for explain, with a deliberate gap
between the blocks so either can grow without renumbering. The verifier and lowering also had the
code duplicated *inside* the message text, which rendered as `STA4031 [ts] STA4031: ...`; the code
is a field, and messages no longer repeat it.

The gate's six placeholder codes became one, `STA1214`. They were not six different facts: every
one of them means "the subset has not reached this yet", they all resolve the same way, and they
all disappear as the lowering ladder climbs. The construct is named in the message; the code names
the boundary. This is the opposite call from the one in entry 15 — there, six constructs shared
`STA1101` while being rejected for six *different permanent* reasons, and splitting them let a
test assert which. Different codes are worth it when they mean different things.

### 32. `tsTypeToHType` typed every literal in every program as `Unknown`
It tested `TypeFlags.Number` but not `NumberLiteral`. The type of `1` is `1`, not `number`, so
`console.log(1 + 2 * 3)` lowered to a tree of `Unknown` and the verifier rejected the compiler's
own output. Same for strings and booleans. `void` also fell through to `Unknown`, so every
`console.log` call did too.

Fixed by matching each primitive's literal flag as well, and mapping `void` to `undefined` — the
HIR models values, and a function that returns nothing evaluates to `undefined` at runtime.
`TypeFlags.NumberLike` was deliberately *not* used: it also covers `Enum`, and `erasableSyntaxOnly`
bans enums, so accepting one as a number would hide a rejection that should happen.

Also fixed alongside: `isImplicitAny` called `getTypeAtLocation` on every node it was given,
including the `SourceFile`, which has no `parent` — TypeScript threw a `TypeError` out of the
compiler. It now asks only about nodes that could have carried an annotation.

### 33. Number literals must be emitted as C *double* literals, not as `String(n)`
`console.log(1e20)` emitted `jsrt_number(100000000000000000000)`, which clang rejects outright:
"integer literal is too large to be represented in any integer type". Two quieter variants of the
same bug: `7` emitted an `int` literal, and `-0` emitted `0`, silently discarding the sign that
`docs/VALUE.md` §1.3 spends a paragraph on.

`cDoubleLiteral()` in `src/codegen/index.ts` now handles the non-finites, preserves `-0.0`, and
appends `.0` to anything `String(n)` renders without a `.` or an exponent. `String(n)` is already
the shortest decimal that round-trips, so the result is both exact and legal C.

Caught by `tests/golden/ts/numbers.ts` on its first run — which is the argument for having built
the golden harness against Node rather than against expectations written next to the code.

### 34. The Stator global environment is a `.d.ts` Stator owns, not Node's or the DOM's
`console` was undefined: compiled programs get neither `@types/node` nor `lib.dom`, and they
should not — a program that type-checked against a global the runtime does not provide would fail
at link time instead of as a diagnostic. `src/frontend/lib/stator.globals.d.ts` now declares
exactly what `libjsrt.a` implements, which today is `console.log`, and it is passed to
`ts.createProgram` as a root file. A declaration there is a promise the runtime has the symbol.

Found at the same time: `lib: ['es2023']` resolved to nothing, leaving the program with no
`Array`, `Object`, or `Number`. TypeScript's `lib` option takes file names — `lib.es2023.d.ts`.

### 35. `if (1)` took the else branch: `jsrt_as_bool` is not ToBoolean
The emitter wrote `if (jsrt_as_bool(cond))` for every condition. `jsrt_as_bool` is
`(v & 1) != 0` — correct for a boxed boolean, whose payload *is* bit 0, and meaningless for
anything else. For `jsrt_number(1.0)` (`0x3FF0...0`) bit 0 is a mantissa bit and happens to be
zero, so `if (1)` ran the `else` branch and `while (n)` never looped.

The same confusion ran through the arithmetic: operands were unwrapped with `jsrt_to_double`,
which reinterprets the 64 bits as an IEEE double. On an actual double that is right; on a boxed
boolean, string, or `null` it reads the tag and payload as a mantissa and produces a garbage
number. So `true + 1` was not `2`, it was noise.

Both are now `jsrt_to_number` (ToNumber) and `jsrt_truthy` (ToBoolean), the real conversions from
`docs/NUMERIC.md` §6.3. `tests/golden/ts/equality.ts` covers the condition cases specifically,
including a `while` whose condition is a bare number.

Worth naming the shape of this bug, because it will recur: the walking skeleton only ever
produced numbers, so a bit-level shortcut and a real conversion were indistinguishable by test.
Two unit tests had been written asserting the shortcut (`assert.match(c, /jsrt_as_bool/)`), which
is the failure mode of testing the emitter's output rather than the program's behaviour — the
tests pinned the bug in place and had to be rewritten, not just re-run.

### 36. Three verifier rules rejected correct IR; STA4005, STA4006 and STA4017 retired
`STA4005`/`STA4006` required `if` and `while` conditions to be `boolean`. Once conditions run
ToBoolean that is simply false: every value is truthy or falsy, so there is nothing to reject.
`STA4017` required `===` operands to have the same type, which rejects `null === undefined` —
legal in JavaScript *and* TypeScript, answering `false`.

All three were true of the Phase 2 fragment and not of the language. That is the distinction a
verifier rule has to meet: an invariant of the IR, not of whatever the IR happened to contain
when the rule was written. Retired in `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md` (never reused, per its own rule)
rather than loosened, since the replacement is "no rule at all".

### 37. The gate accepted `null` and `undefined` with nowhere to put them
`null` is a keyword, so it passed the gate's token fast-path; `undefined` is an ordinary global
binding, so it passed as an Identifier. Neither had an HIR node. `null` reached the lowering's
catch-all (`STA4031`), and `undefined` was reported as "identifier used before declaration"
(`STA4035`) — an *internal error* for a correct program.

The same gate/HIR vocabulary invariant as entry 30, found the same way: by asking what the gate
lets through rather than what the tests happen to exercise. `NullLiteral` and `UndefinedLiteral`
are now HIR nodes. `undefined` resolves through the binding table first, so a local named
`undefined` shadows the global exactly as it does at runtime.

### 38. Deferred knowingly: `+` on strings is still numeric addition
`"a" + "b"` compiles and evaluates to `NaN` rather than `"ab"`, because `BINARY_EMITTERS['+']`
applies ToNumber to both operands unconditionally. The real `+` checks whether either operand is
a string *after* ToPrimitive and concatenates if so, which needs string concatenation — rung 2 of
the lowering ladder (plan §6 Task 3.3).

Recorded here rather than left implicit because it is a *wrong answer*, not a diagnostic: nothing
in the pipeline currently tells the user that this one operator is incomplete. Rung 2 must land
`jsrt_op_add` and a golden test for `"a" + 1` before any program mixing strings and `+` can be
trusted.

---

## 2026-08-29 — Phase 3 Task 3.3 rung 2 (strings + template literals)

### 39. `'ab' === 'ab'` was `false`: strict equality compared strings by pointer

`jsrt_strict_equals` ended in `return a == b` — a comparison of the two NaN-boxed words. For every
primitive that is *stored in* the word that is exactly right. For a string the word is a pointer,
and two identical literals are two allocations, so the answer was `false`.

Confirmed before writing any code, by compiling the two-line program and diffing against Node:

```
$ node src/cli/main.ts build $S/streq.ts -o $S/streq && node $S/run.mjs $S/streq
false        # 'ab' === 'ab'  — Node says true
false        # 'ab' < 'b'     — Node says true
```

Fixed by giving strings their own arm (`jsrt_string_equals`, content comparison) before the
fall-through. The general lesson is the one entry 35 already paid for: **a bit pattern is only a
value for the types that live in the bits.** Every predicate that ends in `a == b` needs an
explicit answer for each pointer-carrying tag, and the number of those tags only grows.

### 40. `'ab' < 'b'` was `false`: relational comparison ran ToNumber on strings

The second line of the same diff. The four relational operators emitted
`jsrt_to_number(l) < jsrt_to_number(r)`, and ToNumber of `'ab'` is NaN, which makes every
comparison false. Abstract Relational Comparison compares as *text* when both operands are strings
and numerically otherwise.

The first implementation was four near-identical functions and cpd caught it at 1.2%. The fix was
not to deduplicate the copies but to write the algorithm the spec actually describes: a three-way
compare with a fourth outcome.

```c
typedef enum { JSRT_ORDER_LT, JSRT_ORDER_EQ, JSRT_ORDER_GT, JSRT_ORDER_UNORDERED } jsrt_order;
```

Modelling `UNORDERED` explicitly is what keeps NaN honest: `a <= b` is **not** `!(a > b)`, because
NaN makes both false at once. The four operators are now one line each, and the trap is stated in
the type rather than remembered in four places.

### 41. Unit tests pinned the emitter's output, and broke — for the second time

Two tests (`arithmetic operators convert with jsrt_to_number`, `comparison operators use
jsrt_to_number`) asserted the *spelling* of emitted C. Both became false the moment `+` and `<`
moved into the runtime, where they belong — the tests failed on a change that fixed two bugs.

That is now four tests rewritten for this reason (entry 36 covered the first two). Recording it as
a standing rule rather than a third incident:

> **A unit test may assert which runtime function the emitter dispatches to. It may not assert how
> the emitter spells the work.** The first is the codegen↔runtime contract. The second is an
> implementation detail, and pinning it makes the test suite vote against every improvement.

The replacements assert `jsrt_op_add(` / `jsrt_bool(jsrt_op_lt(` appear, and pair each with
`assert.doesNotMatch` against the inline spelling — so the test now fails if the emitter *stops*
delegating, which is the thing actually worth protecting.

### 42. All 152 decision tests asserted the same thing: "modules are not-yet"

Rung 1 and rung 2 both ended unable to satisfy plan §6's per-rung Check — *"the construct's
decision tests flip from expected-fail to passing"*. The reason turned out not to be the rungs.

Every fixture ended in `export { x };`. That line was never the feature under test: it was there to
stop `noUnusedLocals` (Stator policy, `src/frontend/program.ts`, not a user tsconfig) rejecting the
declaration. But `export` is a module construct, modules are Task 3.11, and the gate reports the
first blocker it finds — so all 152 fixtures returned `not-yet STA1214` naming *modules*, whatever
construct they were named after. The suite read `0 passed, 152 expected-fail` and had been inert
since the day it was written.

Fixed by replacing the bare `export { x };` with `console.log(x);` — the only value-consuming
construct in today's subset — and only where doing so was *verified* to produce the fixture's own
declared verdict. The rewrite ran per-file with an automatic revert on mismatch, so no fixture's
meaning was quietly changed to make it pass. 17 fixtures now genuinely pass; the 4 files that
really do test imports were skipped by construction.

> **A decision test must not depend on a construct it does not name.** A fixture named
> `template_literals` that fails on modules is not a weak test, it is a test of something else.

The revert list is itself a finding — it recorded mismatches the export had been masking, which are
now visible and are **not** yet fixed:

- `subset_top_level_await_{ts,js}` declare `STA1208`, the gate answers `STA1201`.
- `subset_with_statement_ts` declares `STA1109`, the gate answers `STA1107`.
- `subset_bigint_primitive_{ts,js}`, `subset_regexp_literal_{ts,js}` and
  `subset_nullish_coalescing_js` fail with `STA0012` — a `tsc` diagnostic, so the fixture or the
  `lib` list in `createProgram` is wrong, not the gate.
- Ten `_js.js` fixtures declare `dynamic` but explain to `static` (the tenth,
  `subset_switch_statement_js`, joined the list in rung 3). This one is probably the
  *directives* being wrong rather than the compiler: `js` mode does not mean "untyped", it means
  "infer what you can", and `const x = 1 + 2` is inferable in either mode. Left alone deliberately —
  changing a declared verdict to match observed behaviour is how a test suite stops being evidence.
  Needs an owner decision against `docs/MODES.md`.

---

## 2026-08-29 — Phase 3 Task 3.3 rung 3 (control flow)

### 43. Rung 3 could not start without rung 1's deferred operators

Every decision test this rung exists to unblock — `for_loop_c_style`, `break_and_continue`,
`labeled_statements`, `while_do_while_loops` — is written with `i++` and `result += i`. Rung 1
deferred both:

> `x += 1` is not `x = x + 1` in general — the target is evaluated once, which matters as soon as
> it can be `a[i()]`.

That reasoning is still right, and the deferral was still wrong for this rung: while the only legal
target is a bare identifier, the target *cannot* have side effects, so the fold is exact. The gate
now enforces the precondition the fold depends on (`ts.isIdentifier(bin.left)`) instead of leaving
it as a comment, and plan §6 rung 5 carries the obligation to revisit when index access lands.

Two shapes, not one, and the difference is easy to miss:

- `x += 1` → `x = x + 1`, using the `+` **operator** — so on a string it concatenates. `'5' += 1`
  is `'51'`.
- `x++` → `x = (+x) + 1`, with an explicit unary `+` — because `++` is defined to run **ToNumber**
  first. `'5'++` is `6`.

The unary `+` is the whole difference. Writing `x++` as `x += 1` would have been a silent wrong
answer for every string, which is why `tests/unit/control-flow.test.ts` asserts the shape rather
than trusting the golden tests to happen to cover it.

`++`/`--` and `+=` are accepted **only where their value is discarded** — an expression statement,
or a `for` header's third slot. That restriction lives in the gate, not the lowering, because the
HIR has no node for a value-producing update and the gate's accept set must equal the HIR's
vocabulary. Letting the syntax through and rejecting it a layer down is the exact shape of
plan-notes 30 and 37.

### 44. `for-of` was scheduled by syntax rather than by dependency

Rung 3 was written as *"`for`, `for-of` (arrays), `switch`, `break`/`continue`, labels"*. But
`for-of` iterates an array, and arrays are rung 5 — so the item could never have been completed in
the rung that listed it. Confirmed rather than assumed:

```
$ node src/cli/main.ts build tests/subset/subset_for_of_loop_ts.ts -o /dev/null
tests/subset/subset_for_of_loop_ts.ts:6:23 STA1214 [ts] array literals is not yet supported
tests/subset/subset_for_of_loop_ts.ts:8:1  STA1214 [ts] for...of loops is not yet supported
```

Moved to rung 5 by editing plan §6 (rule 6: plan changes by edit, not drift). The general lesson is
about how the ladder is ordered:

> **Rungs are ordered by what a construct DEPENDS ON, not by what it is spelled like.** `for-of`
> looks like control flow and is really collection iteration.

The gate's `describeKind` used to fold `for`, `for-of` and `for-in` into one label, "for loops",
which is what made the three look interchangeable. They now report separately.

### 45. The switch decision test was testing functions

`subset_switch_statement_ts.ts` wrapped its switch in a `function` so it could `return` from each
clause — so the fixture could not pass until rung 4. Same defect as plan-notes 42, one rung later
and from a different cause: not scaffolding to satisfy a compiler flag this time, but a construct
reached for out of habit because it makes the example read well.

Rewritten to assign into a variable instead. The rule from entry 42 holds without amendment: **a
decision test must not depend on a construct it does not name.** Worth checking the remaining
expected-fail fixtures against it as each rung lands, rather than discovering it one rung at a time.

### 46. Two emitter traps that produce a program that runs and is wrong

Neither is caught by "does it compile":

- **`continue` in a `for` must still run the update.** The obvious lowering jumps to the top of the
  loop, which skips `i++` and hangs on the first `continue`. The continue target has to sit
  *between* the body and the update. `tests/golden/ts/control-flow.ts` covers it with a `continue`
  at `i === 3`, so a regression is an infinite loop in CI rather than a wrong number.
- **C's `break` is captured by the nearest `switch`.** A JavaScript `break` targeting a loop from
  inside a switch would silently leave the switch instead. Rather than track which construct C
  would bind to, every jump is emitted as a `goto` to an explicit label. Uniform, and immune to the
  capture rule entirely.

That choice creates its own hazard: the runtime builds with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`, where an
unused label is an **error**, so emitting `brk_N:` after every loop would turn any plain `while`
into a build failure. The emitter therefore records which labels a `goto` actually targets and
writes only those. Every jump is emitted before its own target line, so no second pass is needed.

Also found while writing the golden fixture: `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch` is on in
`src/frontend/program.ts`, so a **non-empty** clause without a `break` is rejected by the frontend
as `STA0012` even though the emitter lays clauses out to fall through naturally. Empty clauses
still stack (`case 0: case 1:`). This is defensible — it is the flag's whole purpose — but it was
undocumented, and a reader of the emitter would reasonably conclude general fall-through is
reachable. Now stated in `docs/HIR.md` and in the fixture.

One bug of my own, caught by the verifier rather than by a test: the compound-assignment fold
typed its result `H_NUMBER` unconditionally, so `text += 1` on a string produced
`STA4004 assignment target type string does not match value type number`. The type has to come from
the checker, since `+=` inherits `+`'s string behaviour. The verifier earning its keep on a bug
introduced in the same change is the argument for having it.

### 47. Stator was enforcing its own lint policy on the programs it compiles

`src/frontend/program.ts` builds the `ts.Program` for **user source** from a `compilerOptions`
literal that had been copied from the locked `tsconfig.json` in plan §4 — including
`noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters`. Those two govern *Stator's* source, not the source
Stator compiles, and the difference is not cosmetic: with them on, `function f(a, b) { return a; }`
is a hard `STA0012`, so Stator rejected a correct TypeScript program. A `tsc` user can switch them
off in their own tsconfig; a Stator user cannot, because Stator ignores their tsconfig for exactly
these options. They are also the only two options in that list that change nothing about what a
type *means*, so nothing downstream could have depended on them. Removed from the frontend; the
compiler's own `tsconfig.json` keeps both.

Found because the fixture below could not be fixed without it, but the same defect had a second and
worse instance. `strict: true` implies `noImplicitAny`, and js mode was inheriting it — so an
unannotated JavaScript parameter was a compile error in the mode whose entire contract is
"untyped code is never rejected" (`CLAUDE.md`, plan §1). The gate's own implicit-any rule
(`STA1001`, ts mode only) was unreachable for js because tsc rejected the file first. Now
`noImplicitAny: mode === 'ts'`, which is the one place in `createProgram` where a mode-dependent
option is correct: it *is* the mode policy, stated where the mode still exists.

Effect on the decision matrix: `subset_implicit_any_js.js` went from expected-fail to passing with
verdict `dynamic`, which is what plan §1.2 always said it should be.

### 48. Nothing ever checked that an expected-fail marker was still true

`tests/subset/run.ts` counted `// @expected-fail: true` fixtures and `continue`d past them without
evaluating. `AGENTS.md` says the runner "reports (never hides)" the count, and it did — but the
count is not the property that matters. A marker records *the fixture is ahead of the
implementation*, which stops being true the moment the implementation lands, and nothing detected
that transition. The marker then silently exempts a fixture that would now be holding the line, so
the suite quietly shrinks while its headline number stays reassuring.

The runner now evaluates every fixture, expected-fail included, and reports
`now passes — remove the @expected-fail marker` as a **failure** when one matches its declared
verdict and code. A fixture that still throws or mismatches is counted as expected-fail exactly as
before, so the marker keeps its meaning; it just cannot outlive its reason.

Turning it on found **seven** stale markers, only one of which belonged to the rung being worked
on: `subset_async_functions_generators_{ts,js}` (gate answers `STA1201` correctly — a decision test
asserts a verdict, not an implementation), `subset_explicit_any_ts`, `subset_implicit_any_ts`,
`subset_type_annotations_{ts,js}`, and `subset_implicit_any_js` from entry 47. All seven were
verified against `explain --json` before the markers came off. Passing fixtures went 26 → 35 with
no new implementation work — the suite had that coverage already and was declining to use it.

### 49. Rung 4 split into 4a (calls) and 4b (captures), and what 4a leaves standing

Plan §6 rung 4 reads "Functions + closures: environment structs, capture analysis, recursion",
which is two rungs wearing one number. Recursion needs no environment: a self-call resolves through
a *module-level* binding, and `gateIdentifier` already accepts those (a reference whose declaration
has no enclosing function is not a capture). Capturing a function **local** is the part that needs
environment structs. Split, mirroring the 1a/1b precedent: **4a** = functions, parameters, `return`,
calls, recursion and mutual recursion, no captured locals; **4b** = captures and environment
structs. 4a is complete.

The split has a consequence in the emitter worth recording. Module-level bindings can no longer
live in `main`'s frame, because a function body may legally read them; they moved to a file-static
`JSRT_GLOBALS(n)` array whose frame is pushed once at `jsrt_init` time and never popped. `main`
therefore has no `JSRT_FRAME_POP()` — deliberately, since the frame must outlive every call that
can still reach a global. `STA4042` (return outside a function) exists to keep a stray `return`
from popping it.

Two ceilings 4a does not lift. Printing a function in ts mode is not expressible: the `console.log`
shim takes `string | number | boolean | null | undefined`, so the `[Function: name]` branch in
`jsrt_print` is currently reachable only from js mode. And arithmetic on an unannotated js-mode
parameter still stops at `STA4011 arithmetic operand must be number, got unknown` — correct as a
*schedule* (the dynamic representation is Phase 8) but wrong as a *shape*: it is an `STA4xxx`
internal error telling a user who wrote ordinary JavaScript that they found a compiler bug. It
should be an `STA12xx` not-yet naming Phase 8, like `eval` already is. Fixing it means deciding
where the check belongs — the verifier has no mode by design (plan §0.8), so it cannot be there —
and that is a Phase-8 design question, not a rung-4 one. Recorded, not fixed. The js golden fixture
stays inside the pass-through subset for this reason.

---

### 50. Rung 4b's environment representation is decided by the rooting protocol, not by convenience

Rung 4b says "environment structs, capture analysis" and "a closure becomes heap-allocated with an
environment pointer". That leaves the representation open, and the obvious implementations are all
wrong for a reason that is not visible from the rung's own text — it is visible from
`docs/VALUE.md` §4.1, which says the rooting protocol exists so that §12's precise generational GC
does **not** require a codegen rewrite, citing Boa's history via plan §0.7. Every 4b decision below
falls out of that one constraint. Recording them before writing code, because getting this wrong
produces a rung that passes every test under today's Boehm/no-collection runtime and has to be
rewritten wholesale when §12 lands — the exact debt §4.1 exists to prevent.

**Environments, not bare cells.** The textbook lowering gives each captured variable its own heap
cell and holds `JSRTCell *` in a C local. Under Boehm that works, because the conservative
collector scans the machine stack and finds the pointer. Under §12's *exact* root set it is
invisible: nothing in a frame points at the cell, so it is collected while still in use. The
storage must therefore be a `JSRTEnv` reachable by tracing `closure → env → slots`, so a captured
value is found the same way every other live value is.

**The declaring function has to root its own environment.** Tracing through the closure is only
enough once a closure exists and while one is still alive. Between `jsrt_env_new` and the first
closure created from it — and in a function that outlives every closure it made, while still
reading its own captured locals — nothing in the exact root set points at the env. So the env has
to be rooted by the function itself. This is the part that is easy to skip and impossible to
retrofit cheaply, and it is the whole reason this entry exists.

*Corrected while implementing:* this entry first said the env pointer should become a rooted
`jsrt_value` under a new `JSRT_TAG_ENV`. **There is no free tag.** `jsrt_tag` masks with `0x7` — a
3-bit field — and all eight values are allocated (`UNDEFINED NULL BOOL INT32 OBJECT STRING ARRAY
CLOSURE`). Widening the field would take a bit from the 13-bit `JSRT_NANBOX_MASK`, which
`docs/VALUE.md` reserves deliberately so only negative quiet NaNs are tags and the whole positive
NaN space stays available to doubles. An env is not a JavaScript value and does not need to be one:
the root-set unit is the **frame**, so `JSRTFrame` grows a `JSRTEnv *env` field that the collector
traces alongside the frame's slots. `JSRT_FRAME(n)` initialises it to `NULL`; a function with
captured locals points it at its own env. This roots the env exactly, costs no tag, and leaves the
value representation untouched — strictly better than what this entry originally proposed.

**Chain, not flat.** Flat closure conversion copies every transitively-free variable into each
closure's env. Copying a *value* breaks shared mutation (the inner function must see a write the
outer makes afterwards); copying a *pointer to shared storage* reintroduces the cell this entry
just rejected. A parent chain (`env->parent`) keeps one env per env-bearing scope and resolves a
name to (levels-up, index), both compile-time constants the emitter already has from capture
analysis. Only scopes that actually own captured variables get a level, so the walk is over
env-bearing scopes and not over source nesting depth.

**Non-capturing functions keep 4a's static closure.** A function that captures nothing has
`env = NULL` and stays a file-static `_jsrt_closure_N` constant. Only a function with captures
becomes heap-allocated per evaluation, which is what makes two evaluations of the same function
expression close over different variables. 4a's zero-allocation path survives 4b unchanged.

Consequence for the runtime contract: `JSRTClosure.fn` grows an env parameter, so *every* generated
function's C signature changes, non-capturing ones included — `jsrt_call` cannot know which kind it
is dispatching to. That is a `docs/VALUE.md` change, not just an emitter change.

---

### 51. A nested function's own name looked like a capture of itself

Capture analysis walks every identifier and asks the checker where it was declared. The name in
`function c() { … }` is an identifier that resolves to `c`'s own declaration — and that name node
lives *inside* `c`'s subtree, so `enclosingFunction(name)` is `c` while `enclosingFunction(decl)` is
the function around it. The two differ, which is exactly the test for "this is a cross-function
reference", so **every nested function declaration was recorded as a variable its parent must
capture**.

The generated code was not wrong — the emitter stores hoisted function declarations into env slots,
so reading one back through the environment worked. It was wrong about *cost*: a parent holding
nothing but a nested `function` still allocated a heap environment, and the nested function still
lost the file-static closure to a per-call `jsrt_closure_new`. That is the one property entry 50
promised 4b would preserve ("4a's zero-allocation path survives 4b unchanged"), quietly given up on
every function that declares a helper inside itself.

Evidence, `function a(){ const outerVar=1; function b(){ const innerVar=2; function c(){ return
outerVar+innerVar } … } … }`, before and after:

```
a {"envVars":["b","outerVar"],…}          a {"envVars":["outerVar"],…}
b {"envVars":["c","innerVar"],…}          b {"envVars":["innerVar"],…}
```

Fix: skip an identifier that *is* the declaration's own name (`ts.getNameOfDeclaration(decl) ===
node`). Found by writing the unit tests for `analyzeCaptures`, not by any golden fixture — the
fixtures only observe printed output, and this defect changes allocation, not values. It is the
argument for pinning an analysis directly rather than only through what it emits.

### 52. Rung 4b compiles a captured loop variable to the wrong value, so the gate rejects it

`for (let i = 0; …)` gives each iteration a *fresh* `i`; a closure built in iteration 0 must keep
reading 0 after the loop moves on. Rung 4b allocates one environment per **call**, so all iterations
share one slot and every closure reads the final value. Written as a golden fixture it produced
`2, 2` where Node produces `0, 1`.

Two honest options: implement per-iteration environments, or refuse the construct. Per-iteration
environments are a loop-lowering change (allocate in the loop, copy the previous iteration's value
across the update) and belong to whichever rung gives loops their own scopes. Phase 5 step 3 already
owes a golden test for "loop-var closure capture" when it lowers `var`, which is the same machinery
seen from the other side — the two should land together rather than 4b guessing at half of it. What
is *not* an option is emitting a program that runs and prints the wrong number, so the
gate now rejects the shape as `STA1214` (not-yet, Phase 3): an identifier whose declaration sits
inside a loop within the declaring function, referenced from a nested function.

The rejection is deliberately an over-approximation of the broken case — it also refuses a captured
binding declared in a loop *body*, which has the same per-iteration semantics and the same defect.
A closure over a variable declared **outside** the loop is unaffected and is covered by the golden
fixture (`drive()`), because there genuinely is one binding and one slot.

### 53. `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` makes an indexed read `T | undefined`, and that is the point

Rung 5's plan text asks for index access "which brings compound assignment and `++`/`--` to a target
that can have side effects". Writing that program shows it does not currently typecheck:

```
$ node src/cli/main.ts build probe.ts -o /tmp/probeout --mode=ts
probe.ts:13:23 STA0012 [ts] Object is possibly 'undefined'.   // indexed = indexed + a[i];
probe.ts:18:1  STA0012 [ts] Object is possibly 'undefined.'   // a[1] += 5;
```

`a.length`, `console.log(a[0])`, `for (const x of a)` and `a[0] = 10` all compile. What fails is
every read of `a[i]` into a context that wants a `number` — because plan §4 Task 1.0 turns on
`noUncheckedIndexedAccess` for user source, so `a[i]` is `number | undefined`.

**This stays on.** Turning it off would make `HArray`'s element type a claim the emitter is entitled
to act on and the runtime cannot honour: an out-of-range read yields `undefined`, and rung 1b's i32
refinement plus every later unboxing pass exist precisely to trust a `number` as a machine double.
That is golden rule 4 — never trust a type annotation across a boundary — and an index is a
boundary. The flag is also the conservative direction: relaxing it later is compatible, imposing it
later breaks user programs.

The consequence is that `a[i]` lands in the HIR as `Unknown`, and the thing that turns it back into
`number` is **Task 3.5, boundary-check insertion** — the pass whose whole job is materializing a
runtime check where `Unknown` narrows to a concrete HType. `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` is what creates
the narrowing site for it to find; without the flag there would be nothing to insert a check at, and
the "elide bounds checks when the index is provably in range" half of rung 5 would have no check to
elide. So rung 5 delivers the *representation* (dense storage, `jsrt_array_get/set` with their own
in-range test, `.length`, `for-of`, index write) and 3.5 delivers the typed read.

Two knock-on facts, recorded so neither reads as an oversight later:

- **`for (const x of a)` binds the element type, not `T | undefined`** — TypeScript models iteration
  as yielding `T`. That is what keeps ordinary typed iteration on the static path today, and it is
  the idiom rung 5's golden fixture uses.
- **Compound assignment to an element (`a[i] += 1`) is unwritable in *both* modes** until 3.5,
  since even in js mode `const a = [1, 2, 3]` infers `number[]`. The gate still accepts the shape
  and the lowering still implements plan-notes 43's read-once rule, because the load-bearing
  invariant is that the gate's accept set equals the HIR's vocabulary — a construct the HIR can
  express must not be rejected by the gate. It is pinned by a lowering unit test rather than a
  golden test, and the golden test arrives with 3.5.

### 54. A binding's HType came from what it was initialized with, not from what it was declared as

Found while testing rung 5's array literals. `const a: unknown[] = [1, 2]` was binding `number[]`,
because the lowering built the Declaration from `value.type`. The general shape of that bug is not
about arrays at all:

```
$ node src/cli/main.ts build decl.ts -o /tmp/decl --mode=ts   # let x: string | number = 1; x = 'a';
stator: STA4004 internal error in assignment: assignment target type number does not match value type string
stator: this is a compiler bug — please report it with the input
```

Legal TypeScript, reported as a compiler bug. An annotation may be WIDER than the initializer, and
the declared type is what the slot may hold over its whole life; the initializer only says what it
held first. Worse than the spurious diagnostic is the silent half: a later pass entitled to unbox a
`number` slot would have unboxed one that can hold a string.

Two changes, both narrowing the compiler's claims rather than widening them:

- The Declaration takes `checker.getTypeAtLocation(decl.name)` — the binding's type, which is the
  annotation when there is one and the widened initializer type otherwise.
- Assignment into an `unknown` binding verifies clean. `string | number` has no HType, so it is
  Unknown, and every assignment to it is legal precisely because nothing was promised about it.
  This is the same exemption a call's callee already had (STA4041) and an index target now has
  (STA4044): Unknown accepts anything, because that is what the dynamic path IS.

Two decision tests moved as a result, and both moved toward the honest answer:
`subset_nullish_coalescing_ts.ts` is now `dynamic`, because its `const x: number | null` really is
a binding HType cannot describe (it flips back to static when unions land), and
`subset_explicit_any_js.ts` lost a stale `@expected-fail` — `const x: any = 42` now types as
Unknown rather than as the `42` it happened to start with, which is the whole point of `any`.

### 55. Rung 5's dense array cannot represent a hole, so it refuses to make one

`a[3] = 'y'` on an array of length 1 leaves indices 1 and 2 genuinely ABSENT in ECMA-262. It is
observable in the most ordinary way there is:

```
node:   [ 'x', <2 empty items>, 'y' ]
stator: [ 'x', undefined, undefined, 'y' ]
```

The first implementation filled the gap with `undefined` and documented it as a ceiling. That is
the failure mode plan-notes 52 refused for captured loop variables — a program that runs and
prints the wrong answer — and a golden test could not have covered it without being loosened.

Real holes need a sentinel distinct from `undefined` plus the matching arm of Node's
`groupArrayElements`, which is object-model work. So `jsrt_array_set` refuses instead: a write more
than one past the end raises `STA2002` at runtime, the second runtime-emitted diagnostic after
`STA2001`. What that costs is nothing users actually write — replacing an element and appending at
`a[a.length]` both stay, and the counted-loop build `for (…) a[a.length] = …` is the golden
fixture. What it buys is that every array a Stator program can build prints exactly what Node
prints.

### 56. The ladder's next rung is an optimization whose Check does not exist yet

Working top-down after rung 5, the next unmet item is rung **1b**, the i32 refinement. Its stated
precondition is met — `NUMERIC.md` §11 wants §10's tests passing on the f64 path first, and they
are. But §11 also says, in the same paragraph:

> Introducing `i32` is therefore a change that can only *break* things: there is no correctness
> argument for it, only a performance one.

A change justified only by performance needs a performance measurement, and there is none. What
`tests/bench/baseline.json` holds is compile wall-time and binary size:

```
"note": "compileMsBest is the minimum of runsPerFixture wall-clock measurements of `stator build`,
         including Node startup and the clang invocation."
```

That is exactly what plan §5 Task 2.7 asked for, and it says nothing about how fast the emitted
program runs. The compute set that would — fib, nbody, JSON round-trip, string churn — is **Task
6.3**, in Phase 6. So the ladder as written schedules a measured optimization three phases before
its measurement.

Three ways out, and why the third wins:

- **Land 1b unmeasured.** It would be a claim of done on a Check that cannot be run (golden rule 1),
  for a change whose own spec says it can only break things. No.
- **Build Task 6.3's harness now.** Timing a binary is a few lines on top of `tests/bench/record.ts`,
  but the measurement is worthless without fixtures that actually stress numeric loops — so this is
  Task 6.3's substance, not its scaffolding, pulled into Phase 3 to justify one optimization.
- **Defer 1b and say so in the plan.** Nothing depends on it: no `i32` is half-built (`VALUE.md` §5
  still lists the tag as layout only, never emitted), HType has no `i32` kind, and rungs 2–5 all
  landed on the f64 path without wanting one. The cost of waiting is zero and the cost of guessing
  is a performance change nobody can defend.

**plan.md edited:** yes — rung 1b now records the real precondition and points at Task 6.3, and the
ladder continues at rung 6.

---

## 57. A class's field ORDER cannot be read off its member nodes, because a `.js` class has none

**Evidence.** Rung 6a's first working draft built the slot list twice: `classTypeToHType` walked
`declaration.members` for `ts.isPropertyDeclaration`, and `lowerClass` walked the same list again to
build the descriptor the emitter writes. In a `.ts` class the two agreed. In js mode, the fixture
`tests/subset/subset_class_fixed_shape_js.js`:

```js
class Point {
  constructor(x, y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }
}
```

has **no `PropertyDeclaration` at all** — a JS field is declared by `this.x = …` in the constructor,
and TypeScript infers it. Both walks returned an empty list, so the emitted `JSRTClass` would have
claimed zero fields while the constructor wrote slots 0 and 1 of a zero-slot allocation.

**Why it is a plan-level note and not just a bug.** The fix is not "also look at constructor
assignments". It is that the checker's property list is the *only* authority on the layout, because
it is the only one that answers the same way for both modes — and the two derivations were a second
authority waiting to disagree. `classTypeToHType` now iterates `checker.getPropertiesOfType`, and
`lowerClass` derives its `fields` from the resulting `HObject.fields` rather than re-walking. The
descriptor and every `FieldAccess.slot` now come from one list by construction.

This is the same shape of error as plan-notes 54 (a binding's type taken from its initializer rather
than its declaration): two paths to one fact, agreeing on the common case.

**Consequence for the mode contract, which is the good news.** A js-mode class gets the *same*
fixed-slot layout as a ts-mode one, with `unknown` field types — so `subset_class_fixed_shape_js.js`
is `dynamic`, not `not-yet`. The dynamic path here is about what the slots HOLD, not about whether
the object has slots. That is `SUBSET.md`'s "static if fully typed, else dynamic" read literally.

**plan.md edited:** no — this confirms the rung as specified rather than contradicting it.
`docs/SUBSET.md`'s fixed-shape row now records where the slot order comes from.

---

## 58. `this` did not need a node, and that is what made rung 6a small

**The decision.** A constructor or method lowers to an ordinary `FunctionExpr` whose parameter list
begins with a receiver under the unspellable name `' this'`, and `this` in the body lowers to an
`Identifier` reading it. There is no `ThisExpr` in the HIR and no receiver field on `FunctionExpr`.

**Why record it.** Every alternative costs machinery that then has to be maintained by every pass:

- A `this` node needs a case in the verifier, the emitter, both `explain.ts` walkers, and every
  future pass — to express something the existing `Identifier` case already expresses correctly.
- A `receiver` field on `FunctionExpr` splits the calling convention in two: `jsrt_call` would need
  to know whether to pass one, and `MethodCall` and `CallExpr` would stop sharing a layout.

With the parameter reduction, a method inherits **unchanged**: the closure ABI, `jsrt_arg`'s
padding of missing arguments, the static-closure fast path for non-capturing functions, and capture
analysis — including the case that would otherwise be hardest, an arrow inside a method closing over
`this`, which is now just an arrow capturing a parameter. `MethodCall` and `NewExpr` reuse
`CallExpr`'s contiguous-slot layout with the receiver where the callee slot would be.

The one real cost: `analyzeCaptures`'s `FunctionLike` had to grow `MethodDeclaration` and
`ConstructorDeclaration`, because a method IS a scope boundary. That was two lines, and the rest of
the analysis was already generic over the union.

**The constraint it imposes.** The receiver name must stay unspellable. `tests/unit/classes.test.ts`
asserts it does not start with an identifier character, so a later refactor that "tidies" it to
`this` would fail rather than silently let a user binding shadow the receiver.

**plan.md edited:** no. `docs/HIR.md` §1.3 records the reduction and the two invariants beside it.

---

## 59. Rung 6 split into 6a and 6b, on the line where the fixed-slot layout stops working

**6a (done):** classes with fields, one constructor, instance methods, field initializers, `new`,
`this`, field read/write in every assignment form, and method calls.

**6b (not started):** inheritance and `super`, `instanceof`, static members, `#private` fields,
getters/setters (which take the dynamic path per `SUBSET.md`), object literals, and ToPrimitive /
loose equality with objects.

**The line is not arbitrary.** Each 6b item breaks a property 6a's layout depends on:

| Deferred | What it breaks |
|---|---|
| `extends` / `super` | A subclass's layout must start with the parent's, and a method may be overridden — so the compile-time call resolution `MethodCall` performs stops being sound |
| getters / setters | A field READ becomes a call; `SUBSET.md` already routes such classes to the dynamic path |
| `static` members | Belong to the class object, which is a second allocation 6a does not make |
| `#private` | Needs a name that cannot collide with an inherited one — i.e. it needs inheritance first |
| a class as a VALUE | Same: passing `C` needs the class object. Gated out with a `not-yet`, so it fails loudly rather than becoming an internal error |
| object literals | A shape with no declaration to allocate a descriptor for |

Each is a `not-yet` in `gateClass`/`gateNew`/`gateIdentifier` with its own message, so the failure
names the construct rather than the phase.

**plan.md edited:** yes — rung 6 now records the split and 6a's completion.

---

## 60. `a == a` was false: rungs 5 and 6a shipped an object-blind `==`, `+`, and `<`

**Found while starting rung 6b.** The ToPrimitive item was listed as a rung 6b *feature*. It is
not — it is a correctness bug that has been live since rung 5 (arrays), and rung 6a (classes)
widened it. Four runtime abstract operations each had an object-shaped hole:

| Function | Hole | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| `jsrt_loose_equals` | no object row at all; fell to `return false` | `a == a` was **false** and `a != a` was **true** for every array and every class instance |
| `jsrt_to_number` | objects returned NaN | `-[5]` was NaN, `[5] \| 0` was 0 |
| `jsrt_op_add` | tested "either is a string" BEFORE converting | `[1] + [2]` was NaN, not `"12"` |
| `jsrt_compare` | tested "both are strings" BEFORE converting | `["10"] < ["9"]` would compare numerically |

`===`, template literals, and `console.log` were all correct throughout, which is why no golden
test caught it: every fixture that touched an object used one of those three. A probe of 22
expressions against Node found 12 mismatches, all in these four functions; all 12 now agree.

**The fix is one function.** `jsrt_to_primitive` (`runtime/src/jsrt_ops.c`) runs first in each of
the four, and a primitive passes through untouched — so there is one place the spec's ordering can
be right or wrong, not four. It takes **no hint parameter**, and that is a subset fact rather than
a shortcut: the hint only chooses whether `valueOf` or `toString` is tried first, and no object in
the subset has a user `valueOf`, so both hints reach `toString`. `docs/NUMERIC.md` §7 records when
the parameter goes in.

**A second defect fell out of testing it.** The verifier required arithmetic operands to be exactly
`number` (`STA4011`/`STA4012`), so `id(a) - 1` in js mode — legal source the gate accepts — reached
an *internal error*. The emitter has always wrapped every arithmetic operand in `jsrt_to_number`,
which is total, so the rule described the Phase 2 fragment rather than the language; it now admits
`unknown` and still rejects a known non-number. This is the same shape as the retired `STA4014`/
`STA4015`, and it means the gate's accept set was wider than the HIR's vocabulary — the one
invariant plan §0 calls load-bearing. Worth checking the remaining verifier operand rules against
what the emitter actually supports rather than against what rung 1 emitted.

**Not fixed here, recorded for its own change:** `String(x)` produces `STA4035 identifier 'String'
used before declaration` — an internal error for legal source. The gate accepts any identifier with
a resolved symbol, including TypeScript's lib globals, and the lowering has no binding for them.
That should be a `not-yet` from the gate.

**plan.md edited:** yes — rung 6b now lists ToPrimitive as done, with the reason it was not a
feature.

---

## 61. The gate accepted every global and the lowering had a binding for none of them

**The defect recorded at the end of entry 60, fixed.** `String(1)` answered
`STA4035 identifier 'String' used before declaration` — an **internal error**, raised by legal
source. So did `Number`, `parseInt`, `NaN`, `Infinity`, `Math`, `globalThis`, and `console` used as
a value. `gateIdentifier` accepted any identifier whose declaration sat in the same function scope
as its use, and a lib declaration sits at top level, which is the same scope as top-level user
code; the lowering then built bindings only for declarations it lowers, and found nothing.

This is the load-bearing invariant failing in the direction that costs the compiler its own
credibility rather than the user a feature: **the accept set must equal the HIR's vocabulary**, and
the HIR has no vocabulary for the global object. Now a `not-yet` naming Phase 4 (builtins).

**Three spellings only MENTION a global name and had to stay accepted**, each for its own reason —
they are position facts, not syntax facts, which is why they get unit tests rather than decision
tests:

| Spelling | Why it is not a reference |
|---|---|
| `x: String`, `Array<number>` | A type position erases; there is nothing to lower |
| `s.length`, `p.x` | A property NAME is answered by the object's shape, never by scope. That `length` resolves to a lib declaration is an accident of where the type came from |
| `console` in `console.log(x)` | The whole call is one HIR node `gateCall` already vetted, and the walker descends into its children anyway |

**`undefined` is exempted by name, and that is deliberate rather than lazy.** The lowering
special-cases it by name too (`src/lower/index.ts`), so the two sides agree on one single
exception. Both let a user binding of that name win, as the runtime does.

**Two false starts worth recording.** A test on `symbol.valueDeclaration` misses `globalThis` and
`undefined`: the checker synthesizes both, and they have a symbol with **zero** declarations rather
than one in a lib file. And `isDeclarationFile` on a single declaration is not enough — the test is
over *all* of them (`every`), so a name that is also declared in user code stays a user binding.

**Not a regression risk for `NaN`/`Infinity` specifically:** neither ever worked. `tests/golden/ts/
equality.ts` spells NaN as `0 / 0`, which is why nothing caught this.

**plan.md edited:** yes — Phase 4's builtins task now records that the gate defers globals rather
than crashing on them.

---

## 62. `getPropertiesOfType` is own-first, which is the opposite of a prefix layout

**Where:** `src/frontend/types.ts` `classTypeToHType`.

**Evidence.** For `class B extends A { b1 } ` over `class A { a1 }`, the checker's property list is
`[b1, a1]` — own properties first, inherited after. A subclass's layout has to be the reverse: its
slots must START with its base's, in the base's own slot order, or a base-typed read of a subclass
instance lands on the wrong slot. That prefix property is the only thing making `hTypeAssignable`
sound — a `Dog` is a legal value for an `Animal` binding because the first N slots of a `Dog` *are*
an `Animal`.

**First attempt, and why it was wrong.** Ranking each property by its declaring class and
stable-sorting root-first fixes the ts-mode case and silently breaks js mode. A `.js` field is
declared by `this.x = …` in a constructor, so its "declaring class" is not a member node's parent,
and a field assigned in **both** the base and the subclass has a declaration in each. `js/
inheritance.js` caught it: `Counter` assigns `this.count, this.name`; `Stepped` assigns
`this.name, this.step`. Ranking gave `Stepped` the layout `name, count, step` while `Counter`'s own
layout is `count, name` — so the base's `report()` read `this.count` out of `name`'s slot and
printed `2: stepped` instead of `stepped: 1`.

**What landed.** The list is rebuilt from the chain root-first, asking **each ancestor** for its own
property list and skipping names an ancestor already claimed. Each class's list is
own-first-then-inherited, and by the time it is reached every inherited name is claimed, so what
survives is exactly that class's own properties in its own declaration order. First-claim-wins is
also what gives a doubly-assigned `.js` field one slot, at the base's index. No sort is involved;
sorting a merged list cannot express "the base's order" at all.

**plan.md edited:** yes — rung 6b now records inheritance as done.

---

## 63. Method overriding is deferred *separately* from inheritance, and that is the whole design

**The line.** Static dispatch is sound **exactly** while no method is overridden: one name resolves
to one function for every receiver whose type has that class in its ancestry. So inheritance splits
the same way rung 6 did:

- **Landed:** `extends`, `super(...)`, prefix layout, assignability, `instanceof` up the chain,
  synthesized derived constructors. `MethodCall.className` became the class that **declares** the
  method rather than the receiver's own — `d.describe()` on a `Dog` names `Animal` — which is a
  direct call to the one function that exists.
- **Deferred with the vtable:** redeclaring an inherited member, and `super.method()`. Both are
  refused at the gate with a message naming the reason, in both modes. `super.method()` is a call
  that deliberately skips a lookup, which means nothing until there is something to skip.

**Why not just ship vtables now.** The same reason 6a shipped before 6b: a vtable changes what a
`JSRTClass` *is* (a method table, an index per method, a per-class dispatch array) and what a call
site emits, while everything above is a layout question that the existing descriptor answers with
one added pointer. Landing them together would have made one change whose two halves fail for
unrelated reasons.

**Three invariant violations found on the way**, each the load-bearing invariant in the direction
that raises an internal error for legal source:

1. `d.describe()` on an inherited method reached the emitter as `class Dog has no method describe`,
   because the node named the receiver's class.
2. `super.m()` reached the lowering as `STA4031 unexpected expression kind: SuperKeyword`. The gate
   accepted it because `super`'s type IS the base class, so every member-access test passed. The
   refusal now sits in `gateMemberAccess`, where the receiver is examined.
3. A `case ts.SyntaxKind.SuperKeyword:` added to the middle of `visitNode`'s fall-through group made
   `HeritageClause` and `ExpressionWithTypeArguments` fall into it, so every `extends` clause was
   rejected as "super as a value". Caught by the golden fixtures, not by typecheck — a fall-through
   group is a place where adding a `return` is a semantic change to the cases above it.

**Also fixed here:** field initializers were prepended at index 0 of a constructor body, which is
wrong once there is a `super(...)` at index 0 — an initializer may read a field the base wrote
(`doubled = this.sides * 2`). They now go after the super call, which is where JavaScript runs them.

**plan.md edited:** yes.

---

## 64. `this` and `super` were gated by dead code: a token short-circuit swallowed both cases

**Where:** `src/frontend/gate.ts` `gateConstruct`.

**Evidence.** The walker opens with

```ts
if (kind <= ts.SyntaxKind.LastToken && kind !== ts.SyntaxKind.Identifier) {
  return { kind: 'accept' };
}
```

which is right for punctuation and operator keywords. But `ThisKeyword` and `SuperKeyword` are
**tokens**, so `case ts.SyntaxKind.ThisKeyword: return gateThis(node)` had never run — not once,
since it was written. `console.log(this)` at module scope reached the lowering and answered
`STA4061 this outside a class member`, an internal error raised by six characters of legal
JavaScript. The same hole is why the `SuperKeyword` case added for inheritance did nothing, and why
the fix that actually worked for `super.m()` was the one in `gateMemberAccess`.

**What landed.** The exemption list is now `Identifier`, `ThisKeyword`, `SuperKeyword` — the three
tokens that are *expressions reading something* rather than punctuation. Both cases are live, and
`tests/unit/gate.test.ts` pins `this` at module scope as a `not-yet`.

**One case the live check then got wrong, and the fix.** `gateThis` walked up looking for a
constructor or method, so a `this` in a FIELD INITIALIZER (`b = this.a + 1`) — lexically inside no
function — was rejected. `tests/golden/ts/inheritance.ts` caught it immediately. A property
declaration is a `this` position: the lowering moves the initializer into the constructor, where the
receiver is a parameter. Statics are the exception in the other direction — `this` in a static member
is the class object, which this model does not build.

**Lesson worth keeping:** a `switch` on `ts.SyntaxKind` with an early-out over a kind RANGE has no
compiler check that a later case is reachable. Both dead cases typechecked, linted and read
correctly. This is the third invariant leak of the same family this phase (plan-notes 63) and the
only one no test could have caught by construction — nothing was wrong, something was missing.

**plan.md edited:** yes.

## 65. Statics are bindings, not slots — and `Unknown` had to become assignable in both directions

**The model.** A static belongs to the class object; there is no class object in this subset. So a
static is ONE binding for the whole program, named `C.count` — a dot is unspellable in an
identifier, the same trick `RECEIVER` plays with a leading space. Everything follows: a read is an
`Identifier`, a write is an `Assignment`, `C.m()` is a `CallExpr`, and `C.count += 1` reuses the
identifier compound-assignment path unchanged, because a plain binding has no place to evaluate
exactly once. Statics needed **no HIR node, no verifier case and no emitter case** — only a
`statics: readonly Declaration[]` list on `ClassDeclaration` that the enclosing scope walks.

Two details are load-bearing. The name carries the **declaring** class, because statics are
inherited: `Sub.count` and `Base.count` are one static, and mangling by the receiver's spelling
would make a write through one invisible through the other. And names are registered in one pass
before any value is lowered (and again in the verifier), for the reason function declarations hoist
— one static method may call another written below it.

**A pre-existing bug this surfaced.** `hTypeAssignable` demanded exact equality unless the TARGET
was Unknown, so an Unknown VALUE flowing into a typed binding was `STA4004`. That is ordinary
js-mode source:

```js
function add(a, b) { return a + b; }
let total = 0;
total = add(total, 3);   // STA4004: target type number does not match value type unknown
```

Six lines, no classes, internal error. Unknown is now assignable in **both** directions, which is
what the dynamic path means: an Unknown target promises nothing, and an Unknown value is a boxed
`jsrt_value` like every other, stored by a total operation. It is the same exemption arithmetic
operands already got (plan-notes 60's second defect) — the pattern is that a verifier rule written
for ts mode becomes an internal error in js mode wherever it demands a static fact the checker
cannot supply.

**`isClassInstance` had to stop believing the checker.** The type of the expression `C` is the
class's STATIC side, whose symbol is still the class declaration — so `tsTypeToHType` answered
`object` for a class NAME, naming the very layout `new C()` produces, and `C.m()` lowered as an
instance method call on `C`. Only the spelling separates the two, so the test now asks the AST.

**Deferred, with reasons:** a `static {}` initialization block and `this` in a static member (both
need the class object), overriding an inherited static (`D.count` and `C.count` must be one
binding), and `C.name`/`C.prototype` (the class object again).

**plan.md edited:** yes — rung 6b now records statics as done.

## Open items carried forward

- ~~**Phase 0 is not approved.**~~ — resolved 2026-09-01: `NICHE.md` was approved by the owner and
  its commit is tagged `phase-0-approved` (plan §3's Check, restated by entry 135). No agent
  self-approved it; Phase 1 and Phase 2 had run ahead on explicit owner instruction (entries 22).
- ~~**No commits exist yet.**~~ — resolved 2026-08-30: the tree has been committed since.
  Struck 2026-09-04 (entry 190): both lines had gone on reading as live state for three days
  under a heading that says "carried forward", which is what the strike-through convention on the
  third item exists to prevent.
- ~~**`stator explain --json` schema**~~ — resolved, see entry 12 above.

## 66. `#private` is a printing rule, and a corpus that lagged a struct change proved it

**The implementation is nearly empty, and that is the finding.** A `#private` member is an ordinary
member all the way down: `#count` takes a slot in declaration order, `#step()` is a member function,
`static #next` is a static binding named `C.#next`. Nothing below the gate enforces privacy, because
the checker already has: `o.#x` from outside the class body is a TypeScript error before the gate
runs, and js mode gets the same check for free since `#private` is real syntax rather than a type
annotation. There is no name collision to guard against either — no public property may be spelled
with a leading `#`, so `#x` and `x` are two names in the one namespace the layout keys by.

The one place the `#` is still observable is `util.inspect`, which omits `#private` fields. So the
whole feature, below the frontend, is a two-character test in the runtime printer: skip a descriptor
field whose name starts with `#`. The names must STAY in the descriptor — slot *i* of the class is
slot *i* of the descriptor — so the printer counts visible fields first and then walks all slots
skipping hidden ones. A class whose fields are all private prints `C {}`, the same as a class with
no fields, which is right: both have nothing visible to show.

**Two deferrals, both forced by the layout rather than by privacy.** A subclass re-declaring an
ancestor's `#private` name is two distinct slots that share a spelling — the prefix rebuild is
first-claim-wins by NAME, so it would silently merge them and let the base's method write the
subclass's field. And `#brand in o` asks whether an object carries the slot at all, which is not a
question a layout where every instance of a class has every slot can answer; it becomes meaningful
with shapes. Both are `STA1214` with the reason named.

**The corpus lagged the struct, and the Makefile hid it.** `runtime/tests/print_objects.c`
hand-writes ten `JSRTClass` literals, and rung 6b's inheritance work added a fourth member
(`parent`) to that struct. Under `-Wextra -Werror` every one of them is a
`-Wmissing-field-initializers` error — but `pnpm run ci` passed anyway, because the Makefile listed
no header prerequisites anywhere. Editing `runtime/include/jsrt_value.h` rebuilt *nothing*: the
objects were stale, the archive was stale, and the corpus binaries were never relinked. The header
is the codegen↔runtime contract; a build that ignores it can only ever test the runtime the
contract used to describe. Fixed at the root with generated depfiles (`-MMD -MP` plus
`-include $(DEPS)`), which is why a change to a header cannot be silently absent again. Each
`JSRTClass` literal now names `NULL` explicitly.

## 67. Overriding is one bit per method, and the bit is a whole-file question

**The dispatch decision does not belong to the call site.** `a.m()` where `a: Animal` must reach
`Dog`'s `m` if `a` holds a `Dog`, so whether the call can be direct is not a fact about the receiver
expression, nor about `Animal`, nor about the pair — it is a fact about the FAMILY: does any chain
containing `Animal` declare `m` twice? The lowering asks exactly that, of the whole file, once per
call (`isOverridden`). A `no` keeps rung 6a's direct call unchanged, which is why a program that
overrides nothing pays nothing for the feature existing.

**The table is the field layout again.** A class descriptor gained `method_count` and a `methods`
array of file-scope `JSRTClosure` pointers, in the same prefix order the fields have: a subclass's
table begins with its base's, in the base's order. So the slot comes from the receiver's STATIC type
and the entry comes from its DYNAMIC one, and both are right for the same reason a field slot is.
`methodDeclaringClass` already walked leaf-first, which is precisely what a table entry needs: the
most derived declaration this class responds to.

**`super.m()` is the one call that must NOT be virtual.** It is a call on the same receiver with the
override skipped — dispatching it virtually would find the override again and recur forever. So it
lowers to a `MethodCall` whose target is the receiver PARAMETER (not an evaluation of `super`, which
denotes no value) and whose dispatch is `direct` regardless of what the rest of the family does.
`super.x` on a field is refused: a field has one slot per name, so `super.x` and `this.x` are the
same slot and the spelling would promise a distinction the layout cannot make.

**What the table's constness forces.** Entries are file-scope constants, so no method in an
overriding family may capture. A class at module scope has nothing to capture; a class inside a
function may, and there is no per-instantiation table to hold it. The gate refuses overriding there
by asking whether the class declaration's parent is the source file — a syntactic test for a
codegen property, justified because the property is exactly "this class's methods are constants".
Re-declaring a FIELD stays refused for an unrelated reason: a field is a slot, and two declarations
of one slot have two initializers racing for it in an order the layout does not express.

**A mode-policy bug fell out.** `noImplicitOverride` was on in both modes, so js mode demanded a
JSDoc `@override` tag on every overriding method — rejecting ordinary JavaScript for having no
annotation, which is precisely what js mode promises not to do. It is now `mode === 'ts'`, the same
shape `noImplicitAny` already has (notes #48). ts mode keeps it: there the modifier is real syntax,
and an accidental override is exactly the mistake a method table makes silent.

## 68. js mode still rejects legal JavaScript when an override narrows a return type

Found while writing the overriding fixtures, and NOT fixed here:

```js
class A { m() { return 'x'; } }
class B extends A { m() { return 1; } }   // STA0012: Type '() => number' is not assignable to '() => string'
```

Both bodies are untyped. The checker infers `() => string` and `() => number`, finds the override
incompatible with the base, and reports it — and unlike `noImplicitAny` and `noImplicitOverride`
there is no flag to turn off, because base-class compatibility is not a strictness option. js mode's
contract (docs/MODES.md) is that untyped code is never rejected, so this is a contradiction, not a
missing feature.

Recorded rather than fixed because the fix is a policy decision with a wider blast radius: js mode
would have to DOWNGRADE a class of checker errors that arise from inference over unannotated code,
and the set has to be named precisely — an error about an annotation the user wrote must still be an
error. `tests/subset/subset_override_widening_js.js` pins it as an `@expected-fail` decision test so
the day it is fixed is the day that marker comes off.

## 69. Accessors do NOT force the dynamic path — the plan said they did, and it was wrong

`docs/SUBSET.md` promised `dynamic (property access lowers to function call)` for a class with a
getter or setter, and the gate refused such a class outright with the reason "a getter or setter
turns a field READ into a call". Both halves of that were an over-reading of one true fact.

The true fact: `o.x` on an accessor is a call. What does not follow: that the CLASS becomes dynamic.
An accessor is a pair of member functions under a name no source can spell — `get x` and `set x`,
where the space does what the dot does for a static — and the property occupies no slot at all. So:

- the class's real fields keep their fixed slots, and a subclass keeps its prefix layout;
- `o.x` lowers to a `MethodCall` with no arguments, `o.x = v` to one with a single argument;
- dispatch, the method table, arity padding and the receiver parameter all apply unchanged;
- `util.inspect` never prints the property, because the printer prints SLOTS and there is none —
  which is what Node does, and it falls out rather than being arranged.

Nothing else moved. No HIR node, no verifier case, no emitter case, no runtime change: the entire
feature is a mangled name, a branch in `classTypeToHType` that pushes methods instead of a field,
and two branches in the lowering. The `dynamic` verdict in the decision tests became `static`.

**What stayed deferred, each for its own reason.** A compound assignment (`o.x += 1`) is a get and a
set of ONE property, and the machinery that evaluates a receiver exactly once across a
read-modify-write hoists a slot, which an accessor is not. A static accessor belongs to the class
object, which a plain binding is not. A `#private` or computed accessor name has no mangled form
yet. And overriding an inherited accessor is refused because the lowering decides virtual dispatch
by looking for a method DECLARED twice, which is a question about method declarations — accessors
are dispatched directly, and an override would silently reach the base's half.

**A set-only property is the case that catches a lazy implementation.** `set take(v) {}` with no
getter has no read at all, so building the read half of the place unconditionally reports a missing
`get take` on a class that is correct. The read is built only when the getter exists — and the only
forms that would consume it are the compound ones, which the gate already refused.


## 70. An object literal is a class whose declaration is a TYPE (rung 6b)

**Evidence.** `plan.md` rung 6b listed object literals as "the one remaining item that breaks a
property 6a's fixed-slot layout depends on (a literal has no class declaration to be a layout OF)".
That is true of the DECLARATION and false of the layout. The checker already computes an anonymous
object type for `{ x: 1, y: 'two' }`, with a property list in written order — which is precisely
what `classTypeToHType` consumes for a class. The missing piece was never a layout; it was a name.

**What it reduced to.** `shapeTypeToHType` turns a type with nothing but data properties into the
same `hObject` a class produces, named STRUCTURALLY: `{x: number, y: string}`. The leading brace is
what makes the name unspellable, the third instance of the trick the receiver parameter (leading
space), statics (a dot) and accessors (a space) already use. A structural name means two literals
with the same fields are the same HType, so:

- they are assignable to each other, which is what a shape TYPE means in TypeScript;
- the emitter's descriptor cache keys on the name, so one `JSRTClass` is emitted and shared;
- a different key ORDER is a different name, which is correct — order is layout.

The descriptor's C name is the empty string, and `jsrt_print` treats an empty name as "no
constructor name". That is the only runtime change the whole feature needed, and it is what makes
`{ x: 1 }` print bare where `Point { x: 1 }` prints with its class. The HIR gained one node,
`ObjectLiteral` — entries in written order, no descriptor, no keys — and the emitter one sequence
expression: allocate, `jsrt_object_set` per entry, yield the object.

**Why the verifier gained a case (STA4052).** The entries ARE the slots. Nothing downstream carries
a key, so an entry list that disagrees with its shape's field order would emit a silently wrong
object rather than fail. The check is one comparison of two name lists, and it is the only thing
standing between a reordering bug and a golden test that still passes on a symmetric fixture.

**What stayed deferred.** A shorthand, spread, method or accessor member and a non-identifier key
are Phase 3 work: each is statically knowable and simply has nothing to lower to yet. A literal
whose type is not a layout — an optional property, an index signature — is Phase 4 work, because
there is no fixed slot list to build at all; that is the shape table in Task 4.1, and the gate's
message says so rather than pointing at the same phase for both kinds of refusal.

## 71. The duplication budget is measured in LINES, and a type file breaks it (rung 6b)

**Evidence.** Adding `ObjectLiteral` and `ObjectEntry` to `src/hir/nodes.ts` took `pnpm run dupes`
from `25 clones · 0.8%` to `26 clones · 3.0%`, over the 1% threshold. The new clone was reported as
`src/hir/nodes.ts 18-641 ~ 33-668` — 623 duplicated lines in a 672-line file. Measured on that file
alone: `1 clones · 92.7% duplication`, with the same run's own token column reading
`Duplicated tokens: 50 (3.80%)`. Deleting the nine added lines returns it to `0 clones · 0.0%`.

**What that means.** The match is 50 tokens — exactly `minTokens` — and jscpd bills it by the LINE
span between the first and last matching token. In a file that is 60% doc comments, 50 sparse tokens
stretch across 623 lines. The two interfaces did not duplicate anything; they extended a structural
pattern past the detector's floor.

**Why the pattern cannot be factored out.** `nodes.ts` is the HIR's discriminated union and holds no
function, no constant and no logic at all — it is types. A union member is
`interface X extends Node { readonly kind: '…'; … }` by construction, and the `kind` field is the
discriminant every exhaustive switch in the compiler depends on. Deleting the repetition means
deleting the type safety it buys.

**The fix, and why not the other two.** A `jscpd:ignore-start`/`ignore-end` pair wraps the
declarations in `nodes.ts`. It is attached to the code it describes, it says why in the file, and it
leaves any future function in that file checked — the markers open after the import and close at
EOF, so code that is not a declaration would have to be added outside them. Raising `minTokens`
would have hidden real 50-token copies everywhere in the compiler, and adding the file to the config
`ignore` list would have exempted it invisibly, from a file that never mentions why. The threshold
itself stays at 1% and the config is unchanged: `25 clones · 0.8%`.

---

## 72. Map and Set are one implementation, and the plan asked for two (rung 7)

**What the plan said.** `docs/SUBSET.md` split the collections four ways and described the split as
two data structures: a "specialized hash table for primitives, unboxed key/value" that is *static*,
and an "identity-hash table" for object keys that is *dynamic*. Read literally, that is two probe
tables, two comparison functions and two sets of runtime entry points.

**Evidence that one suffices.** The comparison a Map performs is SameValueZero, and it is the only
comparison either collection needs. On a NaN-boxed value:

- a primitive key **is already unboxed** — the box IS the bits, so there is nothing a specialized
  table would strip;
- an object key **is already its pointer** — the box IS the identity, so there is nothing an
  identity table would compute.

The two cases differ only in the hash function, and that difference is four lines inside one
`hash_key`: a number normalizes (`-0` → `+0`, every NaN → canonical) and hashes as a double, a
string hashes FNV-1a over its UTF-16 units, and everything else hashes its box. `runtime/src/jsrt_map.c`
is 270 lines total and serves all four SUBSET rows, plus Set, which is the same struct with the
value half unused and a second `JSRTClass` descriptor to tell it apart.

**What was actually built.** One `JSRTMap`; two descriptors (`jsrt_class_map`, `jsrt_class_set`);
one `same_value_zero`; one `hash_key`. The `Object` tag carries both, because the 3-bit tag field is
fully allocated (`docs/VALUE.md` §1.1) and a builtin cannot have a tag of its own — the descriptor
pointer in the shared object prefix is what distinguishes them, the same trick object literals use.

**The plan and SUBSET.md are edited to match**, and the two "dynamic" rows keep their verdict for a
different and true reason: `Map<object, V>` is dynamic because `object` describes no layout and the
KEY TYPE is Unknown, not because the table underneath is a different one.

**Two facts the rows now state that the plan did not predict.** The type arguments must be on the
CONSTRUCTION — `const m: Map<string, number> = new Map()` types the call itself `Map<any, any>`, so
that spelling is dynamic while `new Map<string, number>()` is static. And every `.get` is dynamic:
the lib types it `V | undefined`, and the HType model has no union. `.has` and `.size` are the typed
reads today, which is the same relation `for-of` has to an array index read (plan-notes 53).

**One gate rule changed to make this reachable.** `isGlobalReference` now answers false for the
callee of a `new`. `new Map()` is one HIR node naming a constructor, never a read of the `Map`
binding, and `gateNew` already refuses every constructor it does not implement — so answering
"global" there only added a second diagnostic to the same span. The builtin is told from a user
`class Map {}` by asking whether every declaration of the symbol lives in a `.d.ts`: the builtin is
declared and never defined, a user class has a body, and a body only exists in a source file.
(`hasNoDefaultLib` looks like that test and is not — it is false for `lib.es2015.collection.d.ts`
and every other split lib file. Only `lib.es5.d.ts` carries the directive.)

**Two duplication fixes the rung forced, both real rather than jscpd artifacts.** Adding the
collection cases took `pnpm run dupes` to `34 clones · 1.1%`, over the 1% threshold. Unlike
plan-notes 71 this was not a line-span illusion: the collection call was the SIXTH copy of "lower
every argument left to right, abandon the call on the first failure" in `src/lower/index.ts`, and
`jsrt_map_clear` was the second copy of the six-field empty state in `runtime/src/jsrt_map.c`. Both
are now one definition — `lowerArguments()` and `map_reset()` — and the argument one is load-bearing
rather than tidy: argument order IS evaluation order, and a drifted copy would reorder a user's side
effects. A third, `num`/`str` written identically in three print corpora, moved to
`runtime/tests/corpus.h`; a corpus is only ground truth while its C and `.mjs` halves build the same
values, so those constructors having one definition is the point rather than a side effect.
`29 clones · 0.9%`, threshold and config untouched.

## 73. Monomorphization is not a pass, and the plan implied it was one (Task 3.4)

**Contradiction.** `plan.md` lists monomorphization under `src/passes/` alongside const-fold, DCE and
inline — i.e. as an HIR→HIR transform. Written that way it needs a clone walker that rebuilds every
HIR node with a substituted type: ~40 node kinds, each of which must be re-derived when a new node
kind lands, and each of which is a place a type parameter can survive by omission.

**Evidence.** The lowering already threads `bindings: Map<string, HType>` through every one of its
33 type-computing sites, and every one of them goes through `checker.getTypeAtLocation`. Lowering
the generic's AST a second time with the substitution installed in that map produces the specialized
HIR directly — one new function (`lowerSpecialization`), no walker, and the substitution applied at
the ONE place a `ts.Type` becomes an HType (`typeAt`). The clone-walker version would have had to
re-implement the same substitution at 40 sites to get the same result.

The stronger argument is the invariant. As a pass, "no type parameter survives" is an obligation on
the walker: it holds until someone adds a node kind and forgets a case, and the failure is silent —
a `T` compares unequal to everything, so it surfaces as an unrelated type mismatch several rules
away. At the lowering it is a property of construction: no code path builds an `HTypeParam` into a
node, because `typeAt` substitutes before the node exists. `STA4054` in the verifier is then a
check on the compiler, not a load-bearing step of the algorithm.

**Two things this cost, both worth it.** The substitution rides in `bindings` under keys no
identifier can spell (`<T>`, the same trick as `RECEIVER = ' this'` and the static's dot) rather
than as a 34th parameter or module-level state — the emitter's leaked-closure-state bug is the
standing argument against the latter. And the specialization is BOUND under `box<number>` while its
`fn.name` stays `box`, so `console.log` prints `[Function: box]`; the emitter takes the name from
`stmt.fn.name ?? stmt.name` for exactly this.

**Recovering the substitution without internals.** TypeScript computes the type arguments during
inference and exposes only the resolved signature, its mapper being private. Unifying the DECLARED
signature's HTypes against the RESOLVED signature's recovers it through the public API, and is exact
rather than heuristic because one signature IS the other instantiated. Unifying on HType rather than
`ts.Type` is what makes instantiation sharing fall out for free: the checker infers `T = 42` for
`box(42)` and `T = 7` for `box(7)` — two distinct literal types — and both map to `number`, so the
two calls share one specialization instead of emitting identical C twice.

**Plan edited** in the same change: Task 3.4 now says where specialization happens and lists what is
deferred (`STA1214`: a generic as a value, generic arrows, constraints, defaults, explicit type
arguments, generic classes). The boxed-`Unknown` fallback instantiation the plan offers for cold
generics is NOT built — §13's bloat budget has not been tripped, and a second code path with no
measurement behind it is the thing §15.4 exists to prevent.

## 74. Union types cost nothing, and a narrowing that cannot be checked must not be refused (Task 3.5)

Three decisions inside boundary-check insertion, all of which the plan left to judgment.

**Unions came free, because the model has none.** `plan.md` lists "discriminated unions" as one of
the narrowings Task 3.5 must handle, and separately lists `union<T1 | T2>` as an HType kind still to
build. The second turned out not to be a prerequisite for the first: `string | number` maps to
`Unknown` today, and a `typeof` guard over it narrows to `string` — which is exactly the shape the
`unknown` case already needed. So `tests/subset/subset_union_types_*` flipped off `@expected-fail`
with no union node written. What is still deferred is the narrowing that reads a DISCRIMINANT field
rather than asking `typeof`; that one does need the model to see the constituents.

The one union rule that had to be added is widening: a union whose constituents all map to a single
HType is that type. `"a" | "b"` is a `string`. Without it `typeof` is unusable, because TypeScript
types `typeof x` as a union of eight string literals — so `const t = typeof x` would have been
`Unknown`, and asking an unknown value what it is would have produced another unknown. This is
widening, not guessing: every constituent gives the same answer, so nothing is invented.

**A narrowing that cannot be checked is dropped, not refused.** The first implementation refused at
the gate any narrowing to a type a tag cannot settle — an object, an array, a signature — on the
reading that the accept set must equal the HIR's vocabulary. It broke ten golden fixtures
immediately: `m.get(k) ?? d` narrows an `Unknown` to `Map<K, V>`, and `x ?? y` narrows one to
`null`, and both had been compiling correctly for rungs. The refusal was buying nothing. Leaving the
value `Unknown` is already sound — nothing downstream trusts a type the HIR does not claim — so the
cast or narrowing lowers to its operand alone and the value stays on the dynamic path it would have
taken anyway. The invariant is intact either way: an `Identifier` typed `Unknown` is a node the HIR
has, so the gate accepted nothing the lowering cannot build.

**The check is per USE, not per binding.** `if (typeof x === "number") { return x + x + x; }` emits
three checks, not one. Hoisting to one would mean asserting that the value did not change between
the reads, which is the kind of unproven reasoning golden rule 4 exists to forbid — and coalescing
them is a job for an optimization pass that can see the assignments, which §13's tripwire already
names as the response if checks dominate a profile.

**Also here:** `jsrt_panic` gained `_Noreturn`. A failed check has no value to return, and without
the declaration every caller needs an unreachable `return` that reads as a path the code can take.

---

## 75. Passes run before the verifier, and inlining is defined by four refusals (Tasks 3.6–3.9)

**Evidence:** `src/passes/{rewrite,constfold,dce,inline,index}.ts`, `tests/unit/passes.test.ts`
(25 tests), `tests/golden/{ts/optimization.ts,js/optimization.js}`, `src/cli/build.ts:118`.

**`optimize` runs BEFORE `verifyHir`, not after the lowering.** The obvious placement is the other
way round — verify the lowering's output, then optimize — and it is wrong for the reason the
verifier exists. The verifier is the only thing between a bug and silently wrong generated C, and
what reaches the emitter is the OPTIMIZED module. Checking the lowering's output instead would
verify a tree nothing emits and leave the one that does unchecked, so a pass that produced ill-typed
HIR would be a clang error against generated code rather than an `STA4xxx`. `build.ts` therefore
lowers, optimizes, verifies, emits, in that order.

**The rewriter needed a list-level hook.** `Rewriter.statement` returns a list, which says "replace"
and "delete" — but not the most ordinary statement-level fact there is: a `return` makes its
FOLLOWING SIBLINGS unreachable. A statement hook can only ever speak for itself. `Rewriter.statements`
sees a whole sequence, and DCE's unreachable-code elimination is written against it. One exception,
which is a language fact rather than a convenience: a `function` declaration after a `return`
SURVIVES, because it is hoisted and holds its binding for the code above.

**Inlining is four refusals, not an analysis.** The HIR has no block-expression, so a general
inliner needs temporaries, a result binding, and every `return` rewritten to an assignment plus a
jump. That machinery wants a measurement and §13's tripwire has not fired. What is built is the case
needing none of it — a body that is exactly one `return <expr>` — bounded by four conditions, each
closing one way substitution changes meaning: (1) one statement; (2) the body names nothing but its
own parameters; (3) every argument is a literal or identifier; (4) types agree exactly, argument to
parameter and result to call.

Condition 2 does the most work and is worth stating separately, because it closes a hazard that has
nothing to do with closures. A body reading a module-level `g`, moved into a caller that has its own
local `g`, silently starts reading the caller's — and the HIR resolves identifiers by NAME, so there
is no scope information available here that could tell the two apart. Declining to move any free
name at all also makes recursion impossible by construction: a recursive body must name itself.
Nothing in `inline.ts` tests for recursion. The same name-only resolution is why a candidate whose
name is bound more than once anywhere in the module is dropped outright: a local `f` shadowing the
module-level `function f` would otherwise be inlined at a call site that never meant it.

Condition 4 is `Unknown` preservation, and it is what makes js mode the interesting half of the
golden pair. `double(21)` in `tests/golden/js/optimization.js` has a `number` argument and an
`Unknown` parameter, so it does NOT inline — substituting would replace an unknown-typed subtree
with a typed one and cancel exactly the boundary check unknown-ness exists to require. Both fixtures
print identically, because Node inlines nothing anywhere.

**The pipeline runs once, not to a fixpoint.** Order is a chain: inlining exposes constants
(`double(2)` becomes `2 * 2`), folding decides branches (`if (1 < 2)` is not a literal condition
until `1 < 2` is `true`), and eliminating branches is what finally makes a function unreachable —
which is why the shake runs last. A second round would find a little more. Iterating until nothing
changes costs compile time and risks a pass pair that oscillates, and that trade wants a measurement
there is none of yet.

**What DCE deliberately does not recognize.** An `if` whose branches both `return` also terminates,
and is not treated as a terminator. That is the first step onto a lattice — then `switch` with a
`default`, then a loop with no `break` — and each step buys a rarer program while widening what a
bug here could delete. Unreachable code in a real source file sits immediately after a jump. For the
same reason the shake covers functions but not classes: `new C()` names its class by string rather
than by an identifier the reference walk would see, and a shake that cannot see a reference is a
shake that deletes live code.

## 76. Exception nodes stay gated until their emitter lands (2026-08-30)

**Evidence:** `src/hir/nodes.ts` adds `ThrowStatement` and `TryStatement`, and `src/lower/index.ts`
can build them, but `src/codegen/index.ts` has no landing-pad implementation. Before this review,
`src/frontend/gate.ts` accepted both constructs; a valid `try { throw 'boom' } catch {}` therefore
escaped the frontend and crashed the emitter with `Unknown statement kind: try-statement`, while
`pnpm run typecheck` failed its exhaustive switches at `src/codegen/index.ts:626` and `:1034`.

Until Task 3.10 is implemented, the gate reports the existing generic boundary code `STA1214` for
`throw`, `try`, and `catch`, and the emitter has explicit internal guards for hand-built HIR. This
keeps user-facing failures diagnostic-only and restores the gate/HIR/emitter invariant without
claiming exception unwinding is complete.

## 77. Exceptions: statements-with-pending-checks forced the comma builders to learn to flush (Task 3.10)

**Evidence.** Task 3.10 as written ("lowering emits per-scope cleanup blocks") reads as if try/catch were the only construct touched. Implementing it touched every call site the emitter produces, for a reason worth recording: a pending-check must sit BETWEEN a call and whatever consumes its result, and the emitter expressed calls as comma expressions *inside* their consumer (`x = (s0 = f, s1 = a, jsrt_call(...))`). There is no place in a comma expression to put `if (jsrt_pending()) goto pad;`.

**Decision.** Calls (plain, method, `new`-with-ctor, `super`) are now emitted as their own statements, result parked in the (rooted) callee/receiver slot, check appended, slot name returned to the consumer. That in turn exposed an evaluation-order hazard in every multi-operand comma builder: with a call in operand N, operands 0..N-1 must already be IN their slots when the call's statements run, or `x + f()` reads `x` after `f` mutates it. The shared `sequencePart` helper does exactly that — call-free operands keep the compact single-line comma shape (golden-C stability, and most expressions), an operand with a prelude flushes the sequence so far as a statement first. Conditional contexts can't even flush: a loop condition re-runs per iteration and a `&&`/`||`/`??` right operand runs only sometimes, so those capture the prelude into a buffer and replay it at the evaluation point (loops restructure to `while (1) { <prelude>; if (!truthy) goto brk; … }` only when the prelude is nonempty).

Also settled here: the finally protocol is a per-try `int` completion code dispatched AFTER the finally body (0 normal, 1 rethrow, 2+ per distinct routed jump), with the dispatch re-invoking the routing logic in the popped context so nested finallys chain; the pending cell overwrites on throw BY CONTRACT (a finally's throw replaces the completion — jsrt_throw.c documents it as required, not tolerated); and a catch whose try body cannot throw is not emitted at all, because its landing pad would be a label nothing jumps to guarding dead code. `STA4057` allocated (verifier: try with neither catch nor finally / binding without catch block); docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md band bookkeeping updated (STA4040–STA4057 taken).

**Plan edit.** Task 3.10 marked ✅ Done with CI figures in the same change.

## 78. Modules: whole-program merge resolves imports by name, so the gate refuses every rename (Task 3.11, 2026-08-30)

**Evidence.** Task 3.11 asks for ESM whole-program v0: import graph from the `ts.Program`, cycles = STA3001 with locations, module-init in topological order. The minimal artifact honoring that is ONE merged Module HIR — each file's statements in topological order (dependencies first, entry last), sharing one binding namespace threaded through `lowerProgram`. In that shape an import binds nothing: `import { x } from './b.ts'` makes the importer's `x` resolve to b's own top-level binding *by name*. Three consequences, each enforced rather than hoped:

1. **Every aliasing shape is refused** (not-yet STA1214, Phase 4): renamed import/export specifiers (`x as y`), default imports, namespace imports, re-exports, non-literal default exports. Name-based resolution cannot honor a rename; accepting one would silently bind the wrong value. `import type` renames stay accepted — erased, nothing to resolve. `export default <literal>` is accepted and lowers to nothing: without default imports, nothing can observe it.
2. **Cross-file top-level name collisions are refused** (not-yet STA1214): two files declaring the same top-level name — exported or not; scopes TypeScript keeps apart — collide in the merge, and the later initializer would silently overwrite the earlier binding. `src/frontend/graph.ts` names both files in the diagnostic.
3. **Cycles are STA3001** with the path spelled (`a.ts → b.ts → a.ts`), found as DFS back edges. ESM gives cycles well-defined semantics only via live bindings + TDZ checks, neither expressible in a merged namespace.

**compilerOptions change** (`src/frontend/program.ts`): `module: NodeNext, moduleResolution: NodeNext` → `module: ESNext, moduleResolution: Bundler, moduleDetection: Force`. NodeNext classifies files by the nearest package.json `type` field and calls a bare directory of `.ts` files CommonJS, which rejects `import` outright under `verbatimModuleSyntax` (observed as STA0012 on the first multi-file smoke). Stator compiles ESM regardless of packaging metadata (plan §1), so Force makes every file a module and Bundler resolves relative specifiers without consulting package.json. Bundler is laxer than Node in one way that matters: it resolves extensionless relative specifiers. The gate re-imposes Node's own permanent ESM rule as **STA1113 (never)**: a relative specifier names its file extension. Bare (package) specifiers are not-yet STA1214 (Phase 7). `Span` gained an optional `file` so `#line` directives name the right file inside the merged program.

## 79. Tree-shaking builtins is the linker's job today, because no builtin is an HIR module yet (Task 3.12, 2026-08-30)

**Evidence.** Task 3.12 says "Builtins are HIR-level library modules; only referenced ones are emitted/linked." The first clause describes a representation that does not exist: every builtin (`console.log`, string/array/Map operations, the numeric protocol) is a C function in `libjsrt.a`, dispatched by the emitter as a `jsrt_*` call — nothing is authored at HIR level, so there is nothing HIR-level to shake, and the emitter already emits only the user's own code. What DID need fixing was the link: a static archive resolves at .o granularity, so hello-world linked 53 `jsrt_*` functions (all of `jsrt_map.o`, dragged in transitively) for the 5 it references.

**Change.** Function-granularity dead-stripping: `runtime/Makefile` adds `-ffunction-sections -fdata-sections` to `CFLAGS_COMMON` (required for ELF `--gc-sections` to have anything to drop; free on Mach-O, where per-symbol subsections are the default), and `linkExecutable` passes `-Wl,-dead_strip` on darwin / `-ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -Wl,--gc-sections` elsewhere. Sanitized builds skip it: ASan registers globals through arrays the linker sees as unreferenced, the documented `--gc-sections` failure mode. Measured: hello-world 72 KB → 51.8 KB, 53 → 5 `jsrt_*` symbols; the < 500 KB size target is met with ~10× headroom, so competitor-release measurement stays deferred until "once stable" arrives and a comparison would mean something. `tests/bench/baseline.json` refreshed with post-strip `binaryBytes`.

**Plan edit.** Task 3.12 marked done with the note that HIR-level builtin modules return when a builtin is actually authored at HIR level (Phase 4+ library work); the shaking mechanism is in place either way and the check (unit test asserting `jsrt_map_new` absent from a hello-world binary, `jsrt_print` present) holds it.

## 80. Dynamic objects: the contextual type decides, and the aliasing hazard is a runtime not-yet (Task 4.1, 2026-08-30)

The plan says "shape table + per-site inline caches only for the dynamic residue" but not which
literals ARE the residue. Evidence forced two decisions:

- **The decisive type is `checker.getContextualType(literal) ?? getTypeAtLocation(literal)`.** In
  `const o: { x?: number } = { x: 1 }` the literal's own type is `{ x: number }` — a perfectly good
  layout — but the binding's type is the annotation, and every later read of `o` types against
  THAT. Building the fixed object would make each such read a dynamic site aimed at a fixed
  receiver, i.e. a guaranteed runtime abort in a program that is plainly meant to work. The
  annotation wins, so gate and lowering both ask the contextual type FIRST and in the same order —
  the two must never disagree, or the gate accepts a literal the lowering cannot build.
- **Structural aliasing is a loud runtime not-yet, `STA2004`, never a silent answer.** The checker
  blesses `const a = { x: 1 }; const b: { x?: number } = a`, so a FIXED-shape `JSRTObject` can
  arrive at a shape-table site. No compile-time rule can catch this without refusing assignability
  the language guarantees; answering the read would mean guessing a slot; so `as_dynobj` splits
  receivers three ways — dynamic (proceed), fixed object (`STA2004`, lifts in Phase 5 when the
  entry points learn to read through a `JSRTClass` descriptor), anything else (`STA4058`, a
  compiler bug, since no emitted site can produce it). Precedent: STA2002 sparse arrays.

Also settled here: the IC protocol (fill on hit only; get-misses never cached — caching absence
would serve `undefined` after a later write with the same stale shape; construction stores carry
`NULL` ICs because a fresh key on a fresh object transitions every time), and `STA4059` verifier
discipline — the three dyn nodes type Unknown by definition, so a concrete type on one is a
narrowing nothing proved. In js mode the shape can come from JSDoc `@type`, which the checker
honors in `.js` files with no new machinery.

## 81. Math builtins: only the exactly-specified operations can land before fdlibm (Task 4.2, 2026-08-30)

The plan's Task 4.2 says "`Math` … a builtin counts as implemented when ≥1 golden test exercises
it and matches Node." For most of Math those two sentences CONFLICT: golden tests diff against
Node byte-for-byte, Node's `sin`/`log`/`exp`/`cbrt`/`hypot` come from V8's vendored fdlibm, and
ECMA-262 §21.3.2 explicitly permits implementation-approximated answers — so the host libm is
allowed to differ from Node in the last ulp, and a golden test for `Math.sin` would be green on
one machine and red on another. Decision: land the EXACTLY-specified surface now (`abs` `ceil`
`floor` `round` `sign` `sqrt` `trunc` `pow` `min` `max` — IEEE-defined or spec-exact, plus all
constants and the `NaN`/`Infinity` globals), defer every approximated operation with the gate's
not-yet until fdlibm itself is vendored (`runtime/vendor/`, like Ryū — golden rule 5's "don't
write a float printer" logic applies to transcendentals too). `Math.random` is deferred with them
for the adjacent reason: no byte-for-byte golden test can exercise it.

The wrappers in `runtime/src/jsrt_math.c` exist for named ECMA/libm disagreements, each cited in
the file: C `round` ties away from zero (ECMA: toward +∞) and `floor(x + 0.5)` breaks at
0.49999999999999994; `fmin`/`fmax` skip a NaN operand (ECMA propagates) and treat the zeros as
equal (ECMA orders -0 below +0); C `pow(±1, ±Inf)` and `pow(1, NaN)` answer 1 (ECMA: NaN).

Two shapes settled here follow existing precedent rather than adding machinery: `MathCall` is a
CollectionOp-style closed-set node (exact arity after the lowering folds variadic `min`/`max`
left into binary nodes — the spec's own comparison order — and zero-argument forms into identity
literals), and `Math.PI`-style constants plus `NaN`/`Infinity` fold to number literals, which
`cDoubleLiteral` already spells (the compiler runs on the pinned Node, so the doubles are
bit-for-bit the ones golden tests expect). `STA4080` opens the verifier's third band; the second
filled at STA4059.

## 82. String builtins: one op table, undefined-padding, and two loud runtime not-yets (Task 4.2, 2026-08-30)

**Decision.** The String slice lands as one `StringOp` HIR node whose vocabulary is a TABLE —
`STRING_OPS` in `src/hir/nodes.ts`, op → {arity, result} — read by the gate (accept set), the
lowering (padding + result type), the verifier (`STA4081`), and the emitter (C names derived
mechanically, camelCase → `jsrt_string_snake_case`). Adding an op is one table row plus one C
function; no consumer can drift from another because there is nothing to keep in sync.

**Padding.** The lowering pads omitted optional arguments with `undefined` literals up to the
table's arity, so every `jsrt_string_*` function has one fixed C signature. Sound because ECMA-262
specifies "if _arg_ is undefined" — explicit `undefined` and absent are indistinguishable — for
every op in the landed set. (Not true of e.g. `Array.prototype.fill`'s end argument semantics
elsewhere; the claim was checked per-op, not assumed.)

**GetSubstitution is implemented, not refused.** Node honors `$$` `$&` `` $` `` `$'` in
plain-string `replace`/`replaceAll` patterns, so refusing them would fail byte-for-byte goldens on
ordinary code; `$n`/`$<name>` stay literal without a RegExp match, exactly per spec.

**Two runtime not-yets under `STA2005`** (fourth runtime-emitted diagnostic, precedent STA2002):
`repeat` with a negative/infinite count — the spec throws RangeError, and builtins cannot join the
throw protocol until exceptions carry across the C boundary — and case mapping above ASCII, which
waits on `libunicode` (vendored with Task 4.3's libregexp). Both abort loudly rather than answer
wrongly, per prime directive 4.

**Dashboard fix.** The coverage renderer's mention-check looked for `String.prototype.trim`
literally, which no source ever spells; prototype namespaces now match call syntax (`.trim(` — the
paren keeps it from matching inside `.trimStart(`). The renderer caught its own gap by flagging 8
correct claims as stale, which is the failure mode it exists to surface.

## 83. Array builtins: the non-callback surface, and lastIndexOf breaks the padding rule (Task 4.2, 2026-08-30)

**Decision.** The Array slice reuses the String slice's whole shape — `ARRAY_OPS` table in
`src/hir/nodes.ts` read by gate/lowering/verifier (`STA4082`)/emitter — and lands only the
methods that take no function argument. The callback-taking majority (`map`, `filter`,
`forEach`, `reduce`, `sort`, …) needs the runtime to call back into compiled code, a protocol
that does not exist; deferring them by name at the gate is honest, and lowering them to inline
loops instead was rejected because an expression-position loop needs block-expression machinery
the HIR does not have.

**lastIndexOf is the padding rule's counterexample.** For every other landed op ECMA-262 gives an
explicitly-passed `undefined` the meaning of an absent argument, which is what makes the
lowering's undefined-padding sound. Array `lastIndexOf` is different: absent `fromIndex` means
`length - 1`, explicit `undefined` means `ToIntegerOrInfinity(undefined)` = `0` — Node answers
`[1,2,1].lastIndexOf(1)` = 2 but `[1,2,1].lastIndexOf(1, undefined)` = 0. It therefore lands
with arity 1 and an explicit position stays deferred, rather than padding a wrong answer in.

**Result-kind additions.** `self` types the result as the RECEIVER's array type
(`slice`/`concat`/`fill`/`reverse` — the last two mutate in place and return the receiver, per
spec) and `element` is Unknown by the IndexAccess precedent: `pop` on an empty array really
answers `undefined`.

**Two spec asymmetries golden-tested.** `includes` uses SameValueZero, so `[NaN].includes(NaN)`
is `true` while `[NaN].indexOf(NaN)` is `-1`; and `-0` matches `0` under both. `join` is also
`Array#toString` — `jsrt_to_string`'s array branch now delegates to `jsrt_array_join`, and
`null`/`undefined` elements join as empty text.

**Shared helpers moved, not duplicated.** `int_or_inf`/`clamp_index`/`relative_index` left
`jsrt_string_ops.c` for `runtime/src/jsrt_index_util.h` (internal header, static inline) so the
two builtin families share one definition of the spec's index steps — and the 1% duplication
gate stays honest.

## 84. console beyond log: a stream flag, not new nodes — and the golden runner grows a stream (Task 4.2, 2026-08-30)

**Decision.** `console.info/debug/warn/error` lower to the SAME `ConsoleLogCall` node as `log`,
plus one field: `stderr: boolean`. Node's five inspect-style methods differ only in destination
(`warn`/`error` → stderr; `info`/`debug` are stdout aliases), formatting is identical, and
nothing downstream ever needs the method name — so the name dies at lowering and the emitter
picks `jsrt_print` or `jsrt_eprint` (the same `print_to` body, parameterized by stream).

**The latent bug this fixed.** The lowering had accepted `warn`/`error` since Phase 2 and mapped
them to stdout — unreachable only because the gate refused them. Landing the gate acceptance
without the stream split would have turned that into a silent wrong answer against Node.

**The golden runner now compares BOTH streams byte-for-byte.** Comparing stdout alone would let
a wrong-stream bug pass invisibly; the stderr comparison is a strengthening of the golden
contract, never a loosening. The compiler's ambient `Console` interface (stator.globals.d.ts)
grew the four methods with the same parameter type `log` promises, which is what `jsrt_print`'s
inspect corpus already holds.

## 85. Object enumeration: one walk, two layouts, and entries is honestly dynamic (Task 4.2, 2026-08-30)

**Decision.** `Object.keys/values/entries` land as a namespace-call node (`ObjectStaticCall`,
MathCall's shape, one rooted slot) over ONE runtime walk (`collect` in `jsrt_object_ops.c`)
parameterized by what each index becomes. A fixed shape enumerates its class descriptor's
`fields` (declaration order); a dynamic shape enumerates its shape chain, filled into offset
order in one pass (insertion order). Both are the ECMA-262 enumeration order for these objects,
because every key either layout can hold is an identifier — the integer-like-keys-first reorder
cannot trigger. The comment in the C file states this as the invariant it is.

**Arguments outside the two layouts are deferred, not approximated.** `Object.keys([1, 2])` is
`['0', '1']` in Node and `Object.keys("ab")` is `['0', '1']` too — neither is an object walk,
and each would need its own arm. The gate refuses them by type (fixed `object` HType or
`isDynamicShape`), with `Object.assign`/`freeze`/`create`/… deferred by name.

**entries makes the verdict dynamic, and that is correct.** `entries` produces `[string, T]`
pairs; the HType model has no tuple, so the element is `hUnknown` and the per-file Unknown walk
reports `dynamic` for a file that uses it. The subset fixtures split accordingly
(`subset_object_static_*` static for keys/values, `subset_object_entries_*` dynamic) — the
verdict is the model telling the truth about what it can type, not a bug to paper over.

**STA4084 follows STA4058's precedent**: raised by the runtime, numbered in the verifier's band,
because it polices the same argument contract from the other side.

## 86. JSON.stringify: the type pin decides the gate, and parse waits for an untyped-result story (Task 4.2, 2026-08-30)

**Observation.** `JSON.stringify` has one honest type only in its single-argument form over serializable values: `string`. The spec's exceptions are exactly the values for which it answers `undefined` instead — a top-level `undefined` or function. And `JSON.parse` is typed `any` by TypeScript's own lib, which ts mode rejects (STA1003) before any gate rule can speak.

**Decision.** Land `stringify` arity-1 as a `JsonStringify` node pinned `string` (verifier `STA4085`), with the pin driving the gate: argument types that admit `undefined` or a function at the TOP level are refused (`STA1214`), because there the runtime would have to answer `undefined` where the node's type promises a string. Inside structures no refusal is needed — the spec itself serializes them (skip as object value, `null` as array element) and the walk implements that. Cycles and an Unknown-smuggled top-level `undefined` abort on the STA2005 pattern: the spec throws `TypeError`, which builtins cannot raise until exceptions reach the runtime boundary. Output details held to Node byte-for-byte: `-0` is `"0"` (JSON, unlike console.log), NaN/Infinity are `null`, lone surrogates escape as `\udXXX` (well-formed JSON.stringify), Map/Set serialize as `{}`.

**Deferred with evidence.** The replacer/space forms change the entire output shape (indentation, filtering) — deferred by arity. `parse` is deferred by name: its result is genuinely untyped, and the honest lowering (dyn values typed Unknown, verdict `dynamic`) is the same story dyn-field reads use — worth landing as its own slice, not as a rider. The ts-mode fixture pins today's truth: `parse` dies as STA1003 (`any` in ts mode) before the gate's not-yet, and will flip to not-yet and then dynamic as the typing story lands.

## 87. The callback protocol already existed: jsrt_call is the whole story (Task 4.2, 2026-08-30)

**Observation.** The Array slice deferred every callback-taking method "pending a runtime→compiled-code call protocol". Examining the closure ABI showed the protocol already shipped with rung 4b: every compiled function is a `JSRTClosure` whose `fn` takes `(argc, argv, env)`, and `jsrt_call` dispatches through it without knowing what kind of caller it has. A runtime builtin calling a callback is indistinguishable from compiled code calling a function value.

**Decision.** `forEach map filter some every find findIndex` land as ordinary `ARRAY_OPS` entries — same table, same STA4082 verifier case, same mechanical C-name derivation (`findIndex` → `jsrt_array_find_index`). Each runtime loop passes the spec's `(element, index, array)` triple (a callee declared with fewer parameters reads the rest as `undefined` through `jsrt_arg`), caches `length` at entry (the spec's ToLength step) while re-checking existence per visit (shrink-then-regrow is visited exactly as Node visits it), and coerces predicate answers with `jsrt_truthy` — ToBoolean, so a predicate returning a number works. Two new result kinds: `mapped` keeps the CHECKER's result type — `map` because its element is the callback's to choose, `filter` because a type-guard predicate legitimately narrows below the receiver's element, and pinning either to the receiver would make the verifier reject well-typed programs; `undefined` is `forEach`. The gate requires the single argument to have ≥1 call signature (an `any`-typed callback in js mode is deferred, not passed to `jsrt_call` to die as a non-closure) and defers the thisArg form of all seven.

**Deferred with evidence.** `reduce`: the absent-vs-present initial value changes both the argument protocol (first call gets `(acc, x, i, arr)` vs `(x0, x1, 1, arr)`) and the result typing — its own slice. `sort`: the DEFAULT comparator sorts by ToString (`[10, 9]` → `[10, 9]`), so landing comparator-only would invite exactly the silent divergence golden tests exist to catch; it lands with a stable-sort implementation decision. Smoke test (closures capturing locals, named function callbacks, the `(w, i, all)` triple, empty arrays, nested arrays): BYTE-IDENTICAL vs Node on first run, including Node's array-grid inspect formatting.

## 88. reduce lands with-initial only, and its result kind pins nothing (Task 4.2, 2026-08-30)

**Observation.** `reduce`'s two forms differ in more than arity: without an initial value the FIRST element becomes the seed and iteration starts at 1, and `xs.reduce(cb, undefined)` seeds with `undefined` rather than the first element — so the undefined-padding rule that folds every other optional argument would silently change the answer, the same trap `lastIndexOf` documented (plan-notes 83).

**Decision.** `reduce`/`reduceRight` land as exact-arity-2 `ARRAY_OPS` entries; the gate defers the 1-argument form by count ("without an initial value is not yet supported"). Their result kind is new: `checker` — the checker's answer, with NOTHING pinned by the verifier, because the accumulator type is whatever the callback and initial value agreed on (number, string, an array being built — the smoke test does all three) and any pin would be the compiler asserting a shape the spec does not have. The runtime loops prepend the accumulator to the callback triple: `(acc, element, index, array)`; `reduceRight` walks down from the ENTRY length with a per-visit existence check, the spec's HasProperty step over a dense representation. Smoke: BYTE-IDENTICAL vs Node first run.

## 89. sort: stability forces the algorithm, and the scratch must be GC-visible (Task 4.2, 2026-08-30)

**Observation.** ECMA-262 §23.1.3.30 makes sort stability normative (since ES2019), which rules out `qsort`. And unlike `reduce`, sort's two forms CAN share a padded signature: SortCompare treats an explicit `undefined` comparator exactly as an absent one, so the standard undefined-padding rule is sound here.

**Decision.** `jsrt_array_sort` is a top-down stable merge over the receiver's own storage. Two details are load-bearing: the merge takes the LEFT run on ties (`<= 0`), which is the entire stability argument; and the scratch buffer is a real jsrt array (`jsrt_array_new` copy), not raw malloc — during a merge an element's only reference is its scratch copy, and the future collector must be able to see it there (the plain-malloc-scratch rule from the Object slice, applied in the other direction). SortCompare's undefined-element rule runs BEFORE the comparator (undefined sinks to the end, comparator never sees one), the comparator's answer is coerced by ToNumber with NaN meaning 0, and the default comparator is ToString + code-unit comparison — `[10, 9, 2, 100, 1].sort()` answers `[1, 10, 100, 2, 9]`, golden-tested. Smoke (default order, stability over equal keys, -0, NaN comparator): BYTE-IDENTICAL vs Node first run.

## 90. The structural quartet: three pad safely, splice does not (Task 4.2, 2026-08-30)

**Observation.** Checking each optional argument against the padding rule (does explicit `undefined` mean what absence means?): `flat`'s depth — yes (`undefined` → default 1, §23.1.3.13); `copyWithin`'s `start` (→ 0) and `end` (→ length) — yes; `splice`'s `deleteCount` — NO: `splice(start)` deletes to the END, `splice(start, undefined)` deletes nothing. The lastIndexOf trap, third occurrence.

**Decision.** `flat` (arity 1, result `mapped` — the checker computes the flattened element type, and a non-literal depth degrades honestly to Unknown), `flatMap` (callback set, result `mapped`, spreads an array answer exactly one level and appends anything else — implemented as depth-0 `flatten_into` of each answer, no intermediate array), `copyWithin` (arity 3, `self`, one memmove over the clamped overlap) land as ordinary padded table entries. `splice` lands at exact arity 2 with a gate count check; the removed run comes back as a fresh array of the receiver's element type (`self`), vacated tail slots cleared to `undefined` for the conservative-scan rule. Insertion `splice` is variadic and waits with variadic `push`. Smoke (negative indices, over-long deleteCount, overlapping copyWithin ranges, filtering flatMap): BYTE-IDENTICAL vs Node first run.

## 91. `'toString' in ARRAY_OPS` was true before toString landed: hasOwn everywhere (Task 4.2, 2026-08-30)

**Observation.** Landing `toString` surfaced a latent gate bug: every table-membership test spelled `op in TABLE`, and JavaScript's `in` walks the prototype chain — so `'toString'`, `'valueOf'`, `'constructor'`, `'hasOwnProperty'` all tested true against EVERY op table since the String slice. `s.valueOf()` would have been accepted, looked up `STRING_OPS.valueOf` (Object.prototype's function, no `arity`), padded against `undefined`, and emitted a call to a C symbol that does not exist — a link error instead of a diagnostic.

**Decision.** Every membership test against an object table (`STRING_OPS`, `ARRAY_OPS`, `CALLBACK_ARRAY_OPS`) is now `Object.hasOwn`; the `Set`-based tables (`MATH_METHODS`, `OBJECT_STATIC_METHODS`, `CONSOLE_METHODS`) were never exposed. A regression test pins `s.valueOf()` to STA1214. The slice itself: `findLast`/`findLastIndex` (downward mirrors, same entry-length + existence discipline), `toReversed`/`toSorted`/`toSpliced` (fresh copy + the mutating op's machinery, `toSpliced` inheriting splice's exact-arity rule), `toString` (= `join` undefined-separator, §23.1.3.36), `with` (copy + replace; out-of-range aborts loudly — spec throws RangeError, builtins cannot). `Array.prototype`: 34/37; the residue is `keys`/`values`/`entries`, which are iterator-protocol work, not builtin work.


## 92. JSON.parse: the annotation is the whole ts-mode story (Task 4.2, 2026-08-30)

**Observation.** `plan-notes` 86 deferred `parse` by name because its result is genuinely untyped, and the deferral note assumed ts mode would have to reject it outright: the lib types the result `any`, and any-in-ts-mode is STA1003 by design. Reading `isImplicitAny` (`src/frontend/types.ts`) showed the assumption was wrong. STA1003 fires only at an ANNOTATION SITE — `annotationSiteOf` returns the node's type annotation for a VariableDeclaration, Parameter, PropertyDeclaration, FunctionDeclaration, ArrowFunction, FunctionExpression, and `null` for every other node — that lacks an annotation AND whose checker type carries `ts.TypeFlags.Any`. So `const v = JSON.parse(t)` is an error and `const v: unknown = JSON.parse(t)` is not, and the difference is exactly the difference the language already draws: writing `unknown` is the program admitting it has data, not a type.

A second question the slice had to answer: what the gate does with an argument it cannot prove is a string. Refusing everything but a `string`-typed argument would make js-mode `parse` nearly useless — the js-mode norm is an untyped `text` parameter, and `any` is not `StringLike`. Accepting everything would read a non-string as text, which is silently wrong for exactly the values that matter. The evidence that settles it: TypeScript's own lib signature (`parse(text: string, ...)`) already rejects a KNOWN non-string in both modes at the STA0012 stage, so a compile-time refusal there buys nothing a type error was not already buying. What is left is the untyped case, which is a tag question, not a type question.

**Decision.** `JsonParse` lowers typed `hUnknown(false)` and the verifier pins nothing (contrast `JsonStringify`, pinned `string` under STA4085): the checker has no claim to check, and a later pass that proves something concrete about a parsed value must be free to say so. The gate accepts a string-ish OR an untyped argument and defers a known non-string (a rule `explain` reports even where a build reports the lib's type error first); the runtime performs the tag check and aborts on the STA2005 pattern. In ts mode the annotated spelling is THE spelling, and `subset_json_parse_ts.ts` stays an STA1003 error to record that the unannotated one still dies at the declaration — the two fixtures together are the documentation. No new diagnostic code: every loud abort reuses the STA2005 pattern, and no compile-time condition here is new.


## 93. The Object namespace is not uniformly unary (Task 4.2, 2026-08-30)

**Observation.** `ObjectStaticCall` was built for `keys`/`values`/`entries`, three methods that take one object, and it carried a single `arg`. `Object.hasOwn(o, k)` does not fit that shape, and `Object.fromEntries(pairs)` fits it only by coincidence — its argument is an ARRAY, the opposite of what the other four accept. Two ways to absorb them: add an optional second field to the node, or give it an argument list with arity fixed per method. The codebase already answers this: `MathCall` carries `args` with a per-method arity table (`MATH_ARITY`), and the collection ops carry a table of shapes with result kinds. An optional field would be a third idiom for a question two already answer.

A second observation fell out of writing the emit: with an argument LIST, `object-static` and `math-call` became the same emit — N arguments into N slots, one C call, no receiver — differing only in the function's name and in math's shortcut for a lone argument, which nests directly because a number is an immediate with nothing to keep rooted. An object argument has to stay rooted, so `object-static` always uses its slots.

A third: both `JSON.parse` and `Object.fromEntries` need a JS string to become a shape key, and `jsrt_json.c` had written that conversion inline — an immortal UTF-8 copy, because the shape table keeps key pointers forever and a collected allocation would be wrong for exactly that reason.

**Decision.** `ObjectStaticCall.args` is a list; the gate's `OBJECT_STATICS` table fixes arity, the receiver kind (`shaped` for a walk, `pairs` for `fromEntries`) and whether a string key follows, and the verifier restates arity and result kinds in `OBJECT_STATIC_SHAPES` — the verifier trusts no earlier stage. The `object-static` emit merged into `math-call`'s case, and the mechanical camelCase-to-snake_case naming became one module-level `snakeCase` used by both it and the array/string ops. `jsrt_shape_key` moved to `jsrt_shape.c`, next to the table whose lifetime rule it implements, and `JSON.parse`'s key path collapsed to a call to it. The deferred residue of the namespace is now documented BY REASON in the gate table's own comment rather than as a backlog: `assign` mutates a target a fixed shape cannot accept, `freeze`/`isFrozen` need a frozen bit every write site would consult, and the prototype four are machinery ts mode bans by design.


## 94. console is a namespace of arities, not of receivers (Task 4.2, 2026-08-30)

**Observation.** `ConsoleLogCall` carried a `stderr` boolean, which was exactly right while the five accepted members differed in nothing else: `log`/`info`/`debug` onto stdout, `warn`/`error` onto stderr, one argument each, one formatting rule. The six members this slice adds break that symmetry in the one dimension the node did not model. `groupEnd()` takes nothing. `count(label?)` and `countReset(label?)` take an optional string. `group(label?)` takes an optional value of the print type. `assert(condition, message?)` takes two with an optional tail. `dir(value)` takes one but is NOT `log` — it keeps a top-level string's quotes. A boolean cannot carry any of that, and neither can a second boolean.

The codebase had already answered the general form of this question twice. `STRING_OPS` and `ARRAY_OPS` are tables of `{arity, optional, result}` that the gate, the lowering, the verifier and the emitter all read, so that an arity is stated once and cannot drift between the stage that admits a call and the stage that emits it. The difference here is only that console's members vary by ARITY where the collection ops vary by RECEIVER; the table shape is the same, and the emitter's needs are smaller — no receiver, no result type, just a C entry point.

The padding rule needed its own check rather than an appeal to precedent, and the check is what saved the slice. Padding an omitted trailing argument with an `undefined` literal is sound only where explicit `undefined` means what absence means — the rule `lastIndexOf` violates (plan-notes 83) and `repeat` and friends satisfy (plan-notes 82). The first cut of this slice padded all four optionals and had the C side read `JSRT_UNDEFINED` as absence. Running the four spellings against the pinned Node before believing it:

```
console.group(undefined)      -> "undefined"                  console.group()      -> (nothing)
console.assert(false, undefined) -> "Assertion failed undefined"  console.assert(false) -> "Assertion failed"
console.count(undefined)      -> "default: 1"                 console.count()      -> "default: 1"
console.countReset(undefined) -> zeroes "default"             console.countReset() -> zeroes "default"
```

So the rule splits the set: `count`/`countReset` pad, and `group`/`assert` cannot — treating `JSRT_UNDEFINED` as absence there prints nothing where Node prints something, for source a program can legally write (`assert(c, msg)` with `msg: string | undefined` is ordinary TypeScript). The same run also caught the separator: Node joins a STRING message with `": "` and anything else with a space and its inspect form, where the first cut always used `": "`.

**Decision.** `CONSOLE_METHODS` in `src/hir/nodes.ts` is the single table — `{arity, optional, fn, bare?}` per member — and `ConsoleLogCall.stderr` became `ConsoleLogCall.method`. `bare` is how a method whose omitted tail is NOT `undefined` reaches the runtime: a second C entry point (`jsrt_console_group_bare`, `jsrt_console_assert_bare`) rather than a sentinel the runtime would have to mistake for absence. That is the third answer to the `lastIndexOf` question — the first two being "pad it" and "refuse the form" — and it is available here only because the runtime function is ours to split. `consoleEntryPoint(method, width)` maps an argument count to the C call or to `null`, and it is the one place the mapping lives: the lowering pads only where `bare` is absent, the verifier asks it rather than trusting the lowering (`STA4019`, which already owned the node's void-ness), and the emitter reads it instead of counting. The gate is unchanged in shape: it admits `arity - optional <= given <= arity`. The stream split is no longer a flag anywhere — it is which C function the table names, and the golden runner's byte-for-byte comparison of BOTH streams (plan-notes 84) is what holds it to Node's, with all four explicit-`undefined` spellings now in both fixtures so the collapse cannot come back.

The four members left out are left out permanently as far as this test suite is concerned, and the reason is the suite itself rather than the difficulty: `time`/`timeEnd` print an elapsed DURATION and `trace` prints a stack, so no golden fixture can pin their output to Node byte-for-byte; `table` is a column-layout algorithm of its own, which is work, not a blocker. Recording that distinction in `SUBSET.md` and in the gate's table matters more than the four members do — a reader should not spend an afternoon discovering that `console.time` cannot be golden-tested.


## 95. The dashboard was 70% of the wrong denominator (Task 4.2, 2026-08-30)

**Observation.** Task 4.2 lists the builtins it covers: `Math`, `JSON`, `String.prototype`, `Array.prototype`, `Object`, `Map`, `Set`, `console`. The coverage table had namespaces for six of those eight. `Map` and `Set` landed at rung 7 — one hash table under two names, with `tests/golden/ts/maps.ts` and `tests/golden/js/maps.js` exercising `get`/`set`/`has`/`delete`/`clear`/`size`/`add` against Node — and were simply never added to the dashboard. Every reported percentage since has been a fraction of a surface that omitted a namespace the plan names, which is the failure mode the dashboard exists to prevent: it counts what has NOT landed rather than hiding it, and a missing namespace hides more than a missing member.

Adding them surfaced a second thing. The renderer verifies each non-empty claim by looking for the member in the fixture's source, and for a `.prototype` namespace the needle was `.member(` — call syntax, with the trailing paren there to stop `.trim` matching inside `.trimStart`. `Map.prototype.size` is a property. No fixture will ever contain `.size(`, so the member could not have been claimed at all; the paren was load-bearing for the wrong reason.

**Decision.** `Map.prototype` (10 members) and `Set.prototype` (16) are namespaces in `builtins_coverage.json`, and the total moved from 102/145 (70%) to 113/171 (66%). Nothing regressed — the denominator got honest, and a dashboard whose number can only go up is not measuring anything. The surface lists are the members a program reaches for on the PINNED Node, which is now written down in the table's own comment: Symbol-keyed members are out, `Map.prototype.getOrInsert`/`getOrInsertComputed` are out as stage-3 additions, and the ES2025 `Set` operations are in because the pinned Node has them and a program can call them.

The needle became access syntax that must not be followed by an identifier character — `/\.member(?![A-Za-z0-9_$])/` — which checks a property and a method alike and still refuses `.trimStart` for `.trim`. It is strictly more general than the paren rule it replaces, and it is what makes `size` claimable.

Both gaps this exposes are one gap: `entries`/`forEach`/`keys`/`values` are missing from `Map`, from `Set`, and (minus `forEach`) from `Array.prototype`, all waiting on the same iteration protocol. That is worth knowing as one blocker rather than three coincidences.


## 96. A `throw` inside an array callback did neither of the two things it must (Task 4.2, 2026-08-30)

**Observation.** Setting out to add `Map.prototype.forEach`, the first question was how `Array.prototype.forEach` handles a callback that throws — the answer being the template to copy. It does not handle it at all. This program:

```ts
const xs: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
try {
  xs.forEach((x: number): void => { console.log(x); if (x === 2) { throw 'stop'; } });
} catch (e) { console.log(typeof e); }
console.log('after');
```

prints `1 2 string after` on the pinned Node and printed `1 2 3 after` compiled. Two distinct failures in one line of output: the walk CONTINUED past the throw (the `3`), and the exception was SWALLOWED (no `string` — the catch never ran). Either alone is a semantics bug; together they mean a compiled program silently runs past a `throw`, which is the worst failure mode in the list.

The cause is that the exception protocol has two halves and the callback slice wired neither. `runtime/include/jsrt_value.h` states the contract: an exception is a per-thread pending flag, and "after every call that can run user code, generated C checks `jsrt_pending()` and jumps to a landing pad". `emitPendingCheck` in the emitter says the same from the other side — a throwing operation is emitted as its own STATEMENT, never inside a consumer's expression, precisely so the check can stand between the operation and its consumer. Both statements were true of `call`, `new` and `method-call`. An `array-op` was neither: the runtime's loop guard asked only `i < len && i < arr(array)->length`, and the emitter returned the op as an expression for a consumer to embed, leaving nowhere for a check to stand.

This is the ordinary shape of the bug this codebase keeps finding: a fact stated in one place ("operations that run user code need a pending check") and a new node kind added without the table that would have forced the question.

**Decision.** The fact becomes a table entry. `ARRAY_OPS` gains `calls: true` on the thirteen ops that call back into compiled code, read through `arrayOpCallsBack` — the `consoleEntryPoint` idiom, because an optional property on an `as const` table is not readable off the union without it. The emitter gives such an op its own statement into the receiver's slot (dead by then) and follows it with `emitPendingCheck`, the same three lines `call` already had. The runtime's ten upward walks now share one guard, `walking(array, i, len)`, whose third conjunct is `!jsrt_pending()`; the three downward walks test it in their loop condition; and `sort` bails out of both `sort_range` and `sort_merge`, the latter skipping its write-back because a half-finished merge would DUPLICATE elements if copied over the receiver. Extracting the shared guard also removed ten copies of a condition, which the duplication budget notices in the right direction.

Two things checked rather than assumed. Getters run user code too — they lower to a `method-call`, which always had the check, so they were never affected (verified on the emitted C). And the partial answers these ops now return (a half-built `map` result, a partly sorted receiver) are exactly what the pending-check contract already says nothing may observe: the consumer jumps to its landing pad instead of reading the slot.

The regression is pinned where it cannot come back quietly: both `array_callbacks` golden fixtures now throw from a callback, a predicate, a comparator and a reducer, and are held to Node byte-for-byte on both streams.

## 97. `forEach` was never an iterator question (Task 4.2, 2026-08-30)

**Context.** Rung 7 landed `Map` and `Set` and deferred, in one breath, "iteration of any kind (`for-of`, `keys`, `values`, `entries`, `forEach`)". Four of those five are the same question — they hand back an ITERATOR, and the subset has no node for one, no `Symbol.iterator` protocol, and no way to spell the object an iterator is. `forEach` is not that question at all. It takes a CALLBACK, and calling a compiled callback is something the runtime has done since the `Array.prototype` callback slice: `jsrt_call`, the same closure ABI every compiled call site dispatches through. It was grouped with the iterator forms because they share a sentence in the spec's table of contents, not because they share a blocker.

**Decision.** `forEach` joins `COLLECTION_OPS` for both collections, under exactly the rules the array callback ops already follow: the gate holds the callback to a function type (an `any` callback in js mode defers rather than reaching `jsrt_call` unvetted), the thisArg form defers (a compiled callback has no `this` to bind), the verifier pins the arity, and the emitter gives the op its own STATEMENT followed by `emitPendingCheck` — plan-notes 96's rule, applied at the point the node was created rather than discovered later by a fixture. The runtime shares one `for_each` over both descriptors, since a Set is the same table with the value half unused: the callback's first argument is the value for a Map and the key for a Set, and the rest of the triple is identical.

**What the slice actually cost.** Not the call — the MUTATION rules. The spec has `forEach` visit entries appended during the walk, skip entries deleted before they are reached, and end when the collection is cleared. The table is append-only with `live` flags, so all three fall out of walking the entry array by index and re-reading `used` each step. Except for one thing: `grow()` is the only operation that RENUMBERS entries, because it compacts dead ones away as it rehashes — and a walk holding an index cannot survive that. A `delete` followed by enough `set`s to trigger a growth would silently skip or repeat entries, and no existing test could have caught it, because nothing before this walked the array from outside the table's own code.

`JSRTMap` therefore gained `uint32_t iterating` — a DEPTH, not a flag, because `forEach` inside `forEach` is legal and the inner walk's exit must not re-enable compaction under the outer one. While it is non-zero, `grow()` preserves dead entries in place (they keep their slots and stay unfindable, since only live entries are re-indexed) and takes a capacity bump whenever the live count alone would not have needed one. Two smaller consequences, both verified rather than assumed:

- `iterating` is initialised in `map_new` and NOT in `map_reset`, even though `map_reset` initialises everything else. `clear()` resets through `map_reset`, and a `clear()` called from inside a `forEach` must leave the counter alone — zeroing it there would re-enable compaction under the very walk that is running.
- Suppressed compaction is not a leak: the walk decrements on exit, and the next growth after that compacts as usual.

**Evidence.** Both `maps` golden fixtures cover the triple, callbacks that take fewer parameters than they are given, delete-and-reinsert ORDER (the reinsert appends at the end), mutation during the walk, growth during the walk (the preserved-index path), `clear()` during the walk, nested walks, a throwing callback, and empty collections — matching the pinned Node byte-for-byte on both streams. Dashboard: 113/171 → 115/171 (67%), `Map.prototype` 7/10, `Set.prototype` 6/16; the residue of the old five-member group is exactly the iterator quartet, which still waits on the protocol.

## 98. A -0 key was stored as -0, and `forEach` made it visible (Task 4.2, 2026-08-30)

**Found by.** The `forEach` slice, immediately. SameValueZero has always been right here — `hash_key` folds -0 into the +0 bucket and `same_value_zero` relies on C's `==`, so `has(-0)` finds a zero written as `0` and vice versa. What was wrong was the STORE: `map_put` kept the key exactly as it was handed, so a Map whose zero key was inserted as `-0` held a -0. Nothing could see it before, because every read path went back through SameValueZero. `forEach` hands the key to user code, and `1 / k` then answers -Infinity where Node answers Infinity; `console.log(m)` prints `Map(1) { -0 => 'first' }` against Node's `Map(1) { 0 => 'first' }`.

**The spec says so explicitly.** §24.1.3.9 step 6 (`Map.prototype.set`) and §24.2.3.1 step 4 (`Set.prototype.add`): "If key is -0𝔽, set key to +0𝔽". It is a normalization at INSERT, not a comparison rule — which is exactly why a table that only ever compared could not have had it.

**Fix.** One guard at the top of `map_put`, shared by `set` and `add` because both already route through it. A number key equal to zero is stored as `+0`; everything else is stored as it came. No lookup changes, because no lookup could tell the difference to begin with.

**Evidence.** Both `maps` golden fixtures now insert `-0` as the first write of its key and read it back three ways — the collection's own printing, the `forEach` key, and `1 / k` — matching the pinned Node byte-for-byte. Note the pre-existing numeric section could not have caught this: it writes `0` before `-0`, so the +0 was already in the table and the second write found it.

## 99. The lib describes Node, not the subset (Task 4.2, 2026-08-30)

**Found by.** The first line of the ES2025 set-operation fixture. `a.union(b)` did not reach the gate at all: `src/frontend/program.ts` handed user source `lib: ['lib.es2023.d.ts']`, so the checker answered *"Property 'union' does not exist on type 'Set<any>'. Do you need to change your target library? Try changing the 'lib' compiler option to 'es2025' or later."* — surfaced as `STA0012`.

**Why that message is wrong twice.** The program is valid JavaScript, and the pinned Node in `.node-version` runs it. And the advice cannot be followed: the `lib` in question is not the user's, it is the one the compiler chooses for them; a user tsconfig does not set it (plan-notes 47).

**Decision.** The lib describes the JAVASCRIPT the differential ground truth implements, not the subset Stator has landed. Those are two different jobs and two different layers: the gate is what states the subset, and its answer for a member the compiler does not do yet is `STA1214`, which names the delivering phase and is actionable. `lib`/`target` for user source therefore move to es2025 (`tests/unit/helpers.ts` follows, so the unit tests see what a build sees). The compiler's OWN tsconfig — plan §4 Task 1.0, locked — is untouched: that one is about the code in `src/`, and es2023 is what it is pinned to.

**Consequence, and it is the intended one.** Raising the lib admits every other ES2024/ES2025 member to the checker: `Object.groupBy`, `Promise.withResolvers`, the `Iterator` helpers, `Array.fromAsync`. All of them are refused by the gate as `not-yet`, which is exactly the diagnostic they deserve — a member Stator has not landed, named with the phase that will. The full suite was re-run for this: no fixture's verdict changed except the ones this slice added.

## 100. The set operations are the first op whose argument is a collection (Task 4.2, 2026-08-30)

**What landed.** The seven ES2025 set operations. Four build a new Set (`union`, `intersection`, `difference`, `symmetricDifference`) and three answer a boolean (`isSubsetOf`, `isSupersetOf`, `isDisjointFrom`). None mutates either operand.

**The new shape.** Every collection operation before these took an ELEMENT — a key, a value, a callback. These take another SET, and the runtime reads it as a `JSRTMap` through `jsrt_as_map`. A wrong argument is therefore not a wrong answer, it is a pointer read as a structure it is not; and neither of the checks the verifier already ran would catch it, because the arity is right and the RECEIVER is a Set. So the seven are a table — `SET_OPS` in `src/hir/nodes.ts`, mapping each to what it answers — that the gate, the verifier and the emitter all read: the gate refuses an argument that is not a Set, the verifier re-checks the argument's type kind and pins the result (a set for four, a boolean for three, `STA4053`), and the emitter reads the same table to decide whether to box the answer with `jsrt_bool`. This is the `ARRAY_OPS`/`CONSOLE_METHODS` discipline applied at the moment a new op family is added rather than after a bug (plan-notes 96 is what that costs otherwise).

**What the spec actually asks for, and what is refused.** The argument is a SET-LIKE record: any object with a numeric `size`, a callable `has` and a callable `keys`, read through GetSetRecord and iterated by calling `keys()`. That is the iterator protocol the subset still has no node for, so a set-like object is `not-yet(STA1214)` and a real Set is read straight out of the table. The subset fixture that spells one out is refused twice, which is the tidiest possible evidence: once for the argument, and once because writing a set-like value at all requires a `keys()`.

**Order is normative, and it is not always the receiver's.** `intersection` walks whichever collection is SMALLER and appends in that one's order — the spec's own branch, not an optimization. Verified on the pinned Node: `{9,8,7,6,5}.intersection({5,6})` is `Set(2) { 5, 6 }`, where the receiver's order would have been `6, 5`. Equal sizes walk the receiver. `union` appends the receiver's elements then the argument's new ones; `symmetricDifference` copies the receiver, then removes or appends per element of the argument, testing membership against the RECEIVER rather than the result being built (the result is losing keys while it runs). `isDisjointFrom` may walk either side, and does walk the smaller one — a boolean has no order to observe, so there the smaller walk really is just an optimization. Both `set_ops` golden fixtures pin every one of these against Node byte-for-byte, including the empty operand, a set against itself, SameValueZero over `NaN`/`-0`, and object elements (identity, so two structurally identical objects are two elements).


## 101. Vendored code is compiled with our warnings, not our warning FLAGS (Task 4.3, 2026-08-30)

**Contradiction.** `AGENTS.md` says the C runtime is built `clang -Wall -Wextra -Werror`, and the
Makefile applied that to everything under `runtime/`. Golden rule 5 says to vendor QuickJS-NG's
libregexp rather than write a regex engine. The two collide on the first build: `cutils.h` has an
unused parameter in an inline helper and `libregexp.c` compares a signed count against an unsigned
one, so `-Wextra -Werror` refuses to compile code we are required to vendor.

**Evidence.** `make -C runtime` on the unmodified vendor tree, before any flag change:

```
vendor/quickjs-ng/cutils.h:283:47: error: unused parameter 'size' [-Werror,-Wunused-parameter]
vendor/quickjs-ng/libregexp.c:2624:24: error: comparison of integers of different signs
    ('int' and 'uint32_t') [-Werror,-Wsign-compare]
```

**Decision.** `runtime/Makefile` gained `CFLAGS_VENDOR` — `-std=c11 -Wall` and the include paths,
without `-Wextra -Werror` — used by the `build/vendor_%.o` and `build-asan/vendor_%.o` rules alone.
Everything in `runtime/src/` keeps the full set. The reasoning is that a warning flag is a policy
about code we WRITE: `-Werror` exists so that a warning in our own source stops the build before it
reaches review, and there is no review here — upstream's source is not ours to fix, and patching it
to silence a warning would break the no-hand-editing rule for a cosmetic reason. What is NOT relaxed
is anything that could hide a real defect in the vendored code: `-Wall` still runs, and the ASan and
UBSan builds cover `vendor/` exactly as they cover `src/`, which is where a genuine memory or
undefined-behaviour bug in the engine would surface. `AGENTS.md`'s sentence now reads as the rule for
`runtime/src/`, which is what it always meant.

## 102. A regexp literal is a literal but not a constant (Task 4.3, 2026-08-30)

**Finding.** The obvious optimization for `/a/g.test(s)` inside a loop is to compile the pattern once
and hoist the object out — a literal with no substitutions looks exactly like the string and number
literals the const-folder already hoists. It is wrong, and observably so.

**Evidence.** ECMA-262 §22.2.4.1 evaluates a RegularExpressionLiteral by *creating* a RegExp object
each time, because `lastIndex` is mutable state ON that object. On the pinned Node:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) console.log(/a/g.test('banana'));  // true true true
const g = /a/g;
console.log(g.test('banana'), g.test('banana'), g.test('banana'), g.test('banana'));
// true true true false
```

The second line is the same pattern against the same subject four times, answering differently each
time, because `/g` reads and writes `lastIndex` and resets it to 0 on a failure — which is exactly
what makes `while (re.test(s))` terminate. Hoisting the first loop's literal would turn it into the
second line. Both spellings are in `tests/golden/{ts,js}/regexp.*` and match Node byte-for-byte.

**Decision.** `RegExpLiteral` is a leaf the emitter compiles at every evaluation: the pattern text is
emitted inline and `jsrt_regexp_new` runs each time the expression is reached, with one rooted frame
slot for the pattern string so it survives the flag string's allocation. The node's doc comment in
`src/hir/nodes.ts` states the invariant, so a future const-folder reads it before it reaches for
this node. The cost is a `lre_compile` per evaluation, which is the price of being right; a cache
keyed on the literal's SOURCE POSITION (one compiled program per site, a fresh object per
evaluation) is the shape a later optimization takes, and it is not this slice's business.

## 103. Three places @@split and @@replace do not do the obvious thing (Task 4.3, 2026-08-30)

**Finding.** The regexp forms of `split` and `replace` look like "find every match, then cut or
substitute". Three details in ECMA-262 §22.2.5 make the obvious implementation wrong, and each one
was found by a golden fixture diverging from the pinned Node rather than by reading ahead.

**Evidence.**

1. `@@split`'s loop is `Repeat, while q < size` (§22.2.5.14 step 14). A match starting AT the end of
   the subject is therefore never attempted, even though it is a real match — and a pattern that can
   match the empty string has one at every position including the last. The first implementation
   scanned `at <= length`, which is right for `replace` and wrong here:

   ```
   stator: [ 'a', 'b', 'c', '' ]      node: [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ]     // 'abc'.split(/(?:)/)
   stator: [ 'a', 'a', '' ]           node: [ 'a', 'a' ]          // 'abba'.split(/b*/)
   ```

   The fix is one guard in split alone: a match whose start is the subject's length ends the walk,
   and step 15's final segment covers what is left.

2. `@@split` builds its splitter with the STICKY flag added (step 7), so an attempt that fails only
   proves there is no match *at that position* — the loop advances one and tries again. `RegExpExec`
   in `@@replace` has no such retry: a forward search has already looked at every later position, so
   a failure ends the scan. That single boolean is the only difference between the two loops, which
   is why `scan()` takes it as a parameter rather than being written twice.

3. `$n` in a replacement is a group reference only where the pattern HAS that group; above the count
   it stays literal, and the two-digit form wins over the one-digit form only when both name a real
   group. `'abc'.replace(/b/, '<$1>')` prints `<$1>` on Node, and a naive substituter prints `<>`.

**Decision.** `runtime/src/jsrt_regexp.c` owns all three algorithms rather than `jsrt_string_ops.c`:
each is a reading of one `scan()` over the vendored executor, and the string file dispatches to them
on the pattern's tag. `lastIndex` follows RegExpBuiltinExec's rule and not the caller's intuition —
read and written only by a `/g` or `/y` pattern, restored untouched by `search` (§22.2.5.9), and
forced to 0 at both ends of a global `replace`. `tests/golden/{ts,js}/regexp_strings.*` pins all of
it, including the two cases above, byte-for-byte against the pinned Node.

## 104. Case mapping is not a per-unit walk, and Sigma proves it (Task 4.3, 2026-08-30)

**Contradiction.** `docs/SUBSET.md` recorded `toUpperCase`/`toLowerCase` as implemented while the
runtime ABORTED on any character above ASCII (`STA2005`, "Unicode case mapping is not yet
supported"). That was the honest state — an ASCII mapping applied to a non-ASCII string is silently
wrong for exactly the characters that made it non-ASCII — but it was a promise against a dependency
that has now arrived: libunicode came into `runtime/vendor/quickjs-ng` with libregexp.

**Evidence.** Three properties a per-code-unit walk cannot have, all pinned in
`tests/golden/{ts,js}/unicode_strings.*` against the pinned Node:

```js
'Straße'.toUpperCase()   // 'STRASSE'  -- one code point becomes TWO
'ﬃ'.toUpperCase()        // 'FFI'      -- one becomes THREE
'\u{10428}'.toUpperCase() // one code point, two code UNITS, and it has a case
'ΟΔΟΣ'.toLowerCase()     // 'οδος'     -- final sigma
'ΣΟΣ'.toLowerCase()      // 'σος'      -- the same character, both forms, one string
```

The last pair is the whole argument: the mapping of U+03A3 depends on what surrounds it, so no
table lookup keyed on the character alone can answer it. Unicode SpecialCasing's Final_Sigma
condition is "a cased character precedes and none follows, skipping case-ignorable characters in
both directions" — which is exactly why libunicode exports `lre_is_cased` and
`lre_is_case_ignorable`, two predicates the regexp engine itself never calls.

**Decision.** `runtime/src/jsrt_unicode.c` owns both operations and works in code points: decode,
map (or normalize), re-encode. The buffer is sized against the exact worst case
(`LRE_CC_RES_LEN_MAX` code points out per code point in, two UTF-16 units each) rather than grown,
because the bound is small and known. A lone surrogate round-trips untouched — it is a legal JS
string and neither operation is entitled to drop it. `jsrt_string_ops.c` keeps its ASCII fast path
and delegates the moment it sees a unit above 0x7F: an ASCII string cannot change shape, so
decoding one would buy nothing. `normalize` joined the same file rather than the string file for
the same reason `jsrt_regexp.c` owns the regexp-driven string methods — the algorithm is the
vendored library's, and this is the bridge to it.

What this slice deliberately did NOT take: `localeCompare` and `toLocaleLowerCase`/
`toLocaleUpperCase`. Those are collation and TAILORED casing — Turkish dotless i, Lithuanian dot
above — which are locale data, not Unicode's own tables, and locale data is Task 4.4's ICU
question. Answering them from the root tables would look right in a test and be wrong for the
locales that are the entire reason those methods exist.

---

## 105. The ICU feature build costs a dependency, not ten megabytes (Task 4.4, 2026-08-30)

**Contradiction.** `plan.md` Task 4.4 reads "Behind a Makefile feature flag, **off by default**
(+10 MB when on — Boa's measured cost)". The flag part landed as written. The number does not
describe what this compiler produces: 10 MB is what Boa pays because Boa links ICU **statically**
into one Rust binary. Stator links the system ICU, so the compiled program grows by two `LC_LOAD_DYLIB`
entries and nothing else, and the cost moves from the binary to a runtime dependency on a shared
library that must be present on the machine that RUNS it.

**Evidence.** The same fixture, built both ways on this machine (macOS 15, clang 17, Homebrew
`icu4c@78`):

```
87112 bytes  unicode_strings.ts, default runtime
87112 bytes  unicode_strings.ts, STATOR_RUNTIME=intl        (identical: dead-stripped, no ICU symbol referenced)
69448 bytes  intl_locale.ts,     STATOR_RUNTIME=intl        (references ICU)
```

`otool -L` on the last one adds exactly `libicui18n.78.dylib` and `libicuuc.78.dylib`; the default
build's only dependency is `libSystem`. What those two dylibs pull in is 37 MB on disk, 32 MB of it
`libicudata` — the CLDR tables, which is the real number and nearly four times the plan's.

**Decision.** Keep the flag, correct the cost, and say where it lands. `plan.md`'s Task 4.4 line is
edited in this change (golden rule 6). Three consequences the plan did not anticipate:

1. **A separate object directory, not a flag on the same one.** `make -C runtime intl` writes
   `build-intl/`, parallel to `build-asan/`. `make` detects a stale timestamp, never a stale
   `-DJSRT_HAVE_ICU`, so reusing `build/` would silently mix objects compiled with and without ICU.
2. **The link flags are written next to the archive** (`build-intl/link-flags.txt`, from the same
   `pkg-config` invocation that compiled it) and read back by `src/cli/build.ts`. Asking pkg-config
   a second time, in a different environment, is how a binary ends up linking a different ICU than
   its archive was compiled against.
3. **`jsrt_intl.c` compiles in BOTH builds.** Without ICU its three entry points are `STA2005`
   aborts naming the flag. The gate refuses them long before that (`STA1215`), which makes the
   gate's refusal an optimisation rather than the only thing between the user and a linker error.

**The locale argument is required, with the flag on.** §22.1.3.12 and §22.1.3.26 read the HOST's
default locale when `locales` is absent, which would make a compiled program's output depend on the
machine that runs it — and every golden test in this repo rests on that not being true. So the
absent form stays refused even under `STATOR_RUNTIME=intl`, and `'a'.localeCompare('b')` is a
`STA1214`, not a bug. `locales` as a string ARRAY and the `options` bag are Intl negotiation this
compiler does not model, and are refused the same way.

**Why the answers match Node byte-for-byte.** `process.versions.icu` on the pinned Node 26.7.0 is
`78.3` with `icu_small: false`, and `/opt/homebrew/opt/icu4c@78` is ICU 78.3 / Unicode 17.0 — the
same CLDR data, so `'ä'.localeCompare('z', 'sv')` answers `1` on both sides for the same reason.
This is a property of THIS machine, not of the design, which is why the intl fixtures are named
`intl_*`, skipped by the default golden run, and proven by `pnpm run test:intl` rather than by
`pnpm run ci` — a CI host without ICU must stay green.

---

## 106. Nothing linked `-lgc`, and no machine had noticed (Task 4.5, 2026-08-30)

**Contradiction.** `runtime/Makefile` has discovered Boehm through `pkg-config bdw-gc` since Task
2.5 and compiles `GC_MALLOC` calls when it finds it. `src/cli/build.ts` — the driver that links
every compiled program against that archive — never passed `$(GC_LIBS)`. The two halves of the
same decision were written in different files and never compared.

**Evidence.** Installing `bdw-gc` (the line `docs/TOOLCHAIN.md` prescribes, needed for this task's
own Check) turned all 79 golden fixtures red at once:

```
Undefined symbols for architecture arm64:
  "_GC_malloc", referenced from:
      _jsrt_string_from_utf8 in libjsrt.a[16](jsrt_string.o)
golden: 79 fixtures — 0 passed, 79 failed
```

Every machine this repo had run on lacked `bdw-gc`, so the fallback path was the only path ever
taken and a link line that could not work was never executed.

**Decision.** The fix is the mechanism Task 4.4 had just built for ICU, generalised: **every** build
records the libraries a program linking its archive needs, into the directory that archive lives in
(`build/link-flags.txt`, `build-asan/`, `build-intl/`), and `src/cli/build.ts` reads that file back
for every flavour. The flags are written by the PHONY target rather than the archive rule, because
installing `bdw-gc` changes the answer without changing a single `.c` file — the archive is
up to date and the flags are not.

**What it cost to not have this.** Nothing yet, and that is the point: under a conservative
collector a missing root is invisible, and under a link that cannot happen the fallback is
invisible too. Both are found by the same thing — actually running the configuration.

## 107. The frame audit found three slots the emitter never writes (Task 4.5, 2026-08-30)

**Context.** `plan.md` Task 4.5 asks for "a codegen test that diffs emitted frames against emitted
locals". `JSRT_FRAME(n)` is written once, at the top of a function, before a line of its body
exists: a counting pass decides n and the emitter then writes whatever it writes. Nothing in C
checks the two agree, and under Boehm nothing at RUNTIME checks either — the collector scans the
stack conservatively and finds the value regardless. It stops being invisible when §12's precise GC
lands, which is the moment the discipline exists to survive.

**Evidence.** `tests/unit/frames.test.ts` emits the C for every standalone golden fixture and holds
each function to four invariants. Written against the tree as it stood, it failed on three separate
over-allocations, all of them the counting pass reserving storage the emitter had a better home for:

1. **A captured local got two homes.** The parameter loop already skipped a name in `fn.envVars`
   ("one variable, one home"), because a captured binding lives in the heap environment and
   `slotRef` reads it there. `countBindings` did not: `closures.ts:_jsrt_fn_0` declared
   `JSRT_FRAME(2)` and wrote only slot 0. Fixed by routing every named binding — parameters,
   declarations, function declarations, `for…of` bindings, catch bindings — through one `bindSlot`
   that holds the rule in one place.
2. **Every function reserved a return slot.** The slot that holds a result across `JSRT_FRAME_POP()`
   was claimed unconditionally, including in functions with no `return <expr>` at all. Now claimed
   after counting, and only if the body produced one. A function that roots nothing then needs a
   frame of zero, which C11 has no array for, so the frame takes the floor `JSRT_GLOBALS(n)` has
   always had: one slot.
3. **`{}` reserved a scratch slot it had nothing to store.** `dyn-object-literal` claimed two slots
   — the object and one value scratch reused per entry — where the empty literal has no entry.

**The one reservation that stays conservative.** A `try`/`finally` claims a slot to stash a caught
exception while the finally body runs. Whether that path exists is decided while EMITTING the try
body (a landing-pad label is marked used, or it is not), long after n had to be final. Predicting it
during counting would mean a second copy of the unwind analysis drifting from the first — precisely
the failure this test exists to catch. So the test counts the allowance instead: one unwritten slot
per finally whose throw path never armed, and every other unwritten slot is a failure.

**Decision.** Keep the audit exact rather than approximate. An over-allocated slot is harmless
today; a counting pass that has quietly stopped describing the emitter it feeds is not, and the
only difference between the two is how long you wait.

---

## 108. Boehm could not see a single reference the runtime held

**Contradiction.** Task 4.5 landed a leak test that proves the collector reclaims garbage. It does.
What no test asked was whether it keeps what is still live — and it did not. Boehm is
*conservative*: it scans memory word by word and retains anything that looks like a heap address.
A `jsrt_value` never looks like one. NaN-boxing puts the tag above bit 48, so every boxed reference
— in a Map's entry table, an array's element buffer, an object slot, a `JSRT_LOCAL` — reads to the
collector as a word that is not a pointer. Every object reachable only through a boxed reference
was garbage the moment the last raw pointer to it left a register.

**Evidence.** A probe built a 200-entry Map of strings, then read the entries back. Twice:

```
--- no collection:
status 0 signal null
stdout: "key-0-payload-that-is-long-enough-to-notice\nkey-150-payload…\n200\n"
--- with collection (200 000 throwaway strings, then GC_gcollect() twice):
status null signal SIGSEGV
stdout: ""
```

Nothing about this is marginal, and nothing about it was visible: every existing golden fixture
allocates far too little to reach Boehm's first collection, so the whole suite passed on the fact
that the collector had never run. The leak test's 10M-object loop *does* collect — and passed
because its objects are genuinely dead.

**Why the one-line fix does not exist.** `GC_set_pointer_mask`/`GC_set_pointer_shift` — Boehm's own
support for tagged pointers, which is exactly this problem — landed after 8.2. The pinned
`bdw-gc 8.2.12` headers do not declare them.

**Fix.** Unbox for the collector at the two places a reference can hide, in one new file,
`runtime/src/jsrt_gc.c`:

1. **The heap.** A custom object kind (`GC_new_kind` + `GC_new_proc`) whose mark procedure masks
   every word with `JSRT_PAYLOAD_MASK` before testing it. All fourteen collected allocations now
   come from one `jsrt_gc_alloc`, so the kind covers the whole heap by construction — previously
   each site spelled its own `#ifdef JSRT_HAVE_BOEHM … GC_MALLOC … #else … malloc … #endif`, which
   is also why the mistake could hide in plain sight.
2. **The roots.** `GC_set_push_other_roots` over the `JSRT_FRAME` shadow stack, unboxing each slot
   into a buffer of raw pointers and pushing that eagerly. This is the first thing that ever *read*
   the shadow stack: until now `JSRT_FRAME` was bookkeeping for a precise GC that has not landed,
   and the C stack scan found locals by accident.

Masking is safe for both word shapes the runtime stores — a boxed payload is the low 48 bits, and a
raw pointer's top 16 bits are zero, which `jsrt_init` already asserts against a real allocation, so
the mask is the identity on raw pointers. A word that is neither (a double, a length) can mask to a
plausible address and retain one object it does not own: ordinary conservative behaviour, costing
memory and never correctness.

**Check.** `tests/golden/ts/gc_reachability.ts` holds a 200-entry Map, a 200-element array and a
local string live across 200 000 throwaway allocations — enough that the collector runs repeatedly
while they are reachable only through boxed references — and prints them back. It is not vacuous:
with the two hooks removed and `GC_MALLOC` restored, the fixture is the one failure in the suite,
`compiled binary exited null` (SIGSEGV). With them, `golden: 80 fixtures — 80 passed, 0 failed`.

**The second cell, found by the same reasoning.** `jsrt_throw`'s pending-exception mailbox is a
`_Thread_local static jsrt_value` — static storage, which a conservative collector reads no better
than it reads the heap. jsrt_value.h had already written the invariant down ("the collector must
trace the pending slot as a root alongside the frame chain") and nothing implemented it. A `finally`
running on the way out is not a hypothetical window: it runs arbitrary code, allocates freely, and
the throwing frame is already popped. `jsrt_pending_slot()` publishes the cell and the root walk
pushes it.

**Honest limit on the second half.** The fixture's `unwinding()` case — value built and thrown in a
callee, caught by the caller, 200 000 allocations in the `finally` between — still passes with that
root removed. It is kept because throwing through a collecting `finally` is worth exercising, but it
does NOT prove the root: at `-O2` the thrown value plausibly survives in a callee-saved register,
which the collector scans. The fix stands on the argument, not on a red test, and the argument is
the same one the mark procedure rests on. This is exactly the sort of thing §12's precise GC exists
to stop depending on.

**What this says about the tests that were green.** They were green on luck: a suite whose programs
are all too small to trigger a collection cannot distinguish a working collector from one that
never runs. The fixture above is the first that forces the question, and every future one that
holds a collection's worth of live data now has something to fail against.

## 109. The v2.1 changelog said there were no commits after commits existed (2026-08-30)

**Contradiction.** The v2.1 verification entry in `plan.md` continued to say “no initial commit”
long after the Phase 1 and Phase 3 implementation snapshots had been committed (`fa13a50` and
`311007d`). That sentence was true when v2.1 was written, but became stale and contradicted the
repository history while still correctly describing the open Phase-0 gate.

**Fix.** Reworded the entry to keep the authoritative fact — Phase 0 has no human-approved
`NICHE.md`/`phase-0-approved` tag and still gates Phase 2 — while recording that implementation
snapshots are now committed.

## 110. Private class fields leaked through object reflection (2026-08-30)

**Finding.** Fixed-class instances exposed `#private` slots through `Object.keys`,
`Object.getOwnPropertyNames`, `Object.values`, `Object.entries`, and `Object.hasOwn`,
although ECMAScript private elements are not ordinary own properties.

**Fix/check.** Reflection now skips private field names in `runtime/src/jsrt_object_ops.c`;
`tests/golden/ts/private.ts` covers keys, names, and ownership while preserving public fields.

## 111. Array filter reread mutated elements after callbacks (2026-08-30)

**Finding.** `Array.prototype.filter` loaded an element for the callback and reread the array
afterward when appending, so a callback mutating that index changed the value being selected.
ECMAScript filter snapshots each visited value before invoking the callback.

**Fix/check.** The runtime now appends the pre-callback value; TS and JS callback golden fixtures
cover the mutation case in `tests/golden/{ts,js}/array_callbacks.*`.

## 112. Dynamic object reflection used insertion order for integer keys (2026-08-30)

**Finding.** Dynamic objects returned integer-like property names in insertion order, producing
different `Object.keys` and `JSON.stringify` output from Node's OrdinaryOwnPropertyKeys ordering.

**Fix/check.** Shapes now expose one canonical order helper that sorts array-index keys numerically
before other keys in insertion order; object reflection and printing share it. Covered by
`tests/golden/{ts,js}/object_builtins.*`.

## 113. Unicode regexp empty matches could loop forever (2026-08-30)

**Finding.** String regexp operations advanced an empty Unicode match by one UTF-16 code unit.
When that landed on a surrogate boundary, the regexp engine rewound and returned the same match,
making `split`/`replace` hang on astral characters.

**Fix/check.** Added the spec's AdvanceStringIndex surrogate-pair step and used it for failed sticky
retries and empty matches; `tests/golden/{ts,js}/regexp_strings.*` covers split and replace.

## 114. Array index validation cast an unchecked double to uint32 (2026-08-30)

**Finding.** `index_of` cast arbitrary doubles to `uint32_t` before checking range. Values such as
Infinity or a huge finite number make that conversion undefined in C and can trip sanitizers.

**Fix/check.** Range and integrality are checked against the double before conversion in
`runtime/src/jsrt_value.c`; runtime builds remain clean under the existing strict warning flags.

## 110. A live diagnostic code had been renumbered, and nothing could tell (Task 4.6, 2026-08-30)

**Contradiction.** `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md` is the sole allocator of `STA` codes, and four codes were
being emitted with no row in it: `STA1216` and `STA1217` from `src/frontend/gate.ts`, `STA4087` and
`STA4088` from `src/hir/verify.ts`. Three were ordinary omissions. The fourth was not: `STA1216` was
top-level await, which the table had already allocated as **`STA1208`** — a live code, renumbered in
place. Nothing failed. No test references a code that is never emitted, and no check compares the
emitted set against the allocated one, so a renumbering reads as a clean build in both directions:
the old code silently stops existing, and the new one silently starts.

**Fix.** `gate.ts` emits `STA1208` for top-level await again, and the Promise-callback diagnostic
took `STA1216` so the not-yet band stays contiguous — with its `phase` corrected from 4 to 5, which
is where a runtime-level catch around a JS callback actually lands. `STA4087`/`STA4088` got the rows
they never had. The reserved ranges in `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md` moved to match (`STA1217–STA1299`,
`STA4089–STA4999`), and `STA1207`/`STA1208` lost the "Phase 4" label they no longer deserve — both
are Phase 7 module features, corrected in `docs/SUBSET.md` too.

**What made it findable.** Reading every `code: 'STA` in `src/` and diffing that set against the
table's rows — a script, not an eye. Worth automating into `ci` as a bidirectional check (emitted ⊆
allocated, and each allocated code either emitted or explicitly retired), which is the only thing
that would have caught this at the commit that introduced it rather than a phase later. Not done in
this task; recorded here so the next diagnostics change has the reason in front of it.

## 111. The subset matrix claimed a feature was deferred while it compiled (Task 4.6, 2026-08-30)

**Contradiction.** `docs/SUBSET.md` carried `async`/`await` and generators as ONE row, marked
not-yet under `STA1201`, and the decision tests agreed — `subset_async_functions_generators_{ts,js}`
asserted `not-yet`. But async functions already compiled, and had since the codegen work that landed
`jsrt_async_start`. Only generators were still refused. The bundled row made the matrix wrong about
both: it under-reported what worked and hid that the gate's `STA1201` had narrowed to generators
alone.

**Fix.** Split the row and the fixtures. `subset_async_functions_{ts,js}` assert `static`/`dynamic`;
`subset_generators_{ts,js}` assert `not-yet` with `STA1201`, and the `SUBSET.md` code row for
`STA1201` is generators-only. The js-mode async fixture is `dynamic`, not `static` — an untyped
parameter widens to `Unknown`, and an await of an `Unknown` is a dynamic await.

**Second finding, from the same fixtures.** `subset_top_level_await_{ts,js}` had been carrying
`@expected-fail: true` on the belief that js mode answered `STA0012` (a TypeScript-level syntax
error) rather than the gate's diagnostic. It does not. That verdict came from running `explain` on a
`.js` file WITHOUT `--mode=js`, which defaults to ts mode, where a `.js` root trips `allowJs` and
fails before the gate ever sees the await. The subset runner passes `--mode` from the `@mode`
directive, so both fixtures report `STA1208` correctly and the markers came off. A diagnostic read
from a hand-run CLI invocation is only as trustworthy as its flags.

## 112. Task 4.6 promised generators and Phase 4 ends without them (Task 4.6, 2026-08-30)

**Contradiction.** `plan.md` Task 4.6 is titled "`async`/`await` + generators", and `STA1201` said
so too: *"async/await and generators are not yet supported; planned for Phase 4 (runtime v1)"*. The
async half landed. The generator half did not, and Phase 4 has no other task that could deliver it —
so the phase would have closed with a diagnostic naming it as the deliverer, pointing at a phase
that was over. A not-yet code whose named phase has already shipped is worse than no phase at all:
it reads as a schedule and is actually a dead end.

**Evidence for the split.** What Task 4.6 built is the suspension mechanism — a body re-entered at
numbered resume points, with the locals that outlive a suspension living in a heap environment. A
generator needs all of that and one more thing the async work had no reason to build: the ITERATOR
protocol. An `await` answers a *scheduler*, which is why `jsrt_promise_subscribe` is the whole
interface; a `yield` answers its *caller*, through an object with `next`/`return`/`throw` that hands
back `{ value, done }`. That protocol is not generator-specific, and the builtins dashboard had
already been saying so from the other end: `entries`, `keys` and `values` are the exact residue of
`Array.prototype` (34/37), `Map.prototype` (7/10) and `Set.prototype` (13/16), missing for one
shared reason, alongside `for-of`.

**Fix.** Four surfaces, one blocker, one owner: **Phase 5, step 8** now carries the iterator
protocol with generators last, and `STA1201` names Phase 5 in the gate, in `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md` and
in `docs/SUBSET.md` — with its message narrowed to generators, since async no longer reports it.
Phase 5 is where it belongs on the merits rather than by elimination: the protocol is core language
surface both modes need, and it is lowering work, not runtime work, so Phase 4 was never its home.

## 115. `plan.md` split: finished work moved to `done.md` (2026-08-31)

**Problem.** `plan.md` had grown to 761 lines and 494 of them were completion records — Phase 3's
Task 3.3 alone was 275 lines of rung-by-rung evidence. The file is read top-down to find the first
unmet Check (§15.1), so every landed task made that job harder. A roadmap that grows as work
finishes is measuring the wrong thing.

**Split.** Evidence narratives for Phases 1-3 (complete) and Phase 4's landed tasks moved to a new
`done.md` (493 lines). `plan.md` is now 387 lines and holds open work only.

**What deliberately did NOT move**, because the split must not cost anything:
1. **Normative residue.** The locked `tsconfig.json` stays in §4 — it is normative under §15.7 and
   changing it requires a plan edit. `done.md` is an archive; nothing in it binds.
2. **Live Checks.** Phase 4's Check stays in §7: the phase is open (Task 4.2 in progress).
3. **Unlanded parts of landed tasks.** Task 4.2's gate rule ("every global except `console.log` and
   `undefined` is deferred with a not-yet") is behaviour, not history, and stayed.
4. **Task numbers and titles.** Roughly 60 `plan.md §N Task X.Y` references live in `docs/`, `src/`,
   `runtime/src/` and `tests/`. Every task keeps a struck-through one-line stub in `plan.md` under
   its original section, so all of them still resolve — in both files, since `done.md` repeats the
   numbering. Section numbers §0-§16 are unchanged.

**Verification.** Every line of the pre-split `plan.md` at least 60 characters long was checked to
appear verbatim in `plan.md` + `done.md`. Three do not, all intentional: the Phase 1 intro paragraph
(rewritten — its "nothing is committed yet" follow-up is closed as of the 2026-08-30 commits) and
the Phase 2 and Phase 3 headers (retitled `✅ COMPLETE`). One line WAS lost by the first pass — the
Task 4.2 gate rule in item 3 — and this check is what caught it; it was restored.

**AGENTS.md edited:** yes. Golden rule 1 now requires moving a task's record to `done.md` in the
same change its Check passes, and names the four things that never move. The workflow gains the
step and the repo map gains the file.

**Numbering note.** This entry is **115** because 110-114 are taken and **110, 111 and 112 are each
used twice** — a second run restarts at 110 partway down the file. That predates this change and is
not fixed here: commit 5e9f2b4 already cites "plan-notes 112", and renumbering an evidence log to
resolve a collision is the same mistake `DIAGNOSTICS.md` forbids for codes. Owner call.

## 116. Phase 4 had a Check but no scope, so its not-yet codes had nowhere to point (2026-09-01)

**Root cause.** Entry 112 fixed `STA1201`'s dead-end phase pointer one code at a time. It was one
instance of a structural defect: **Phase 4 never defined what it contained.** It has a Check
(runtime tests, ASan, leak test, dashboard renders, one async golden test) but no scope boundary, so
"is Phase 4 done?" was unanswerable — and four more codes named it as their deliverer while it
closed. Fixing pointers one at a time would have kept reproducing the bug.

**What the audit found**, beyond the five known pointers:
1. **`Date` was owned by nobody.** `STA1210` and `SUBSET.md` both named "Phase 4 Task 4.2", but
   Task 4.2's builtin list is `Math`, `JSON`, `String.prototype`, `Array.prototype`, `Object`,
   `Map`, `Set`, `console` — `Date` is not in it, and `Date` is not on the dashboard at all.
2. **`SUBSET.md` and `DIAGNOSTICS.md` disagreed.** `STA1207` and `STA1208` were **Phase 7** in
   `SUBSET.md` and **Phase 4** in `DIAGNOSTICS.md`, with the gate emitting 4. Phase 7 is FFI;
   neither code has anything to do with it. Nobody had reasoned either number.
3. **Task 4.2's completion bar is unmeetable for three members.** "A builtin counts as implemented
   when ≥1 golden test exercises it and matches Node" cannot ever be satisfied by `Math.random`,
   `Date.now()` or zero-argument `new Date()`. `random` sits in `builtins_coverage.json` with an
   empty fixture list, counted against coverage, so `Math` could never exceed 42/43 and the phase
   exit could never be reached. The only existing carve-out (`intl_*`) is about the BUILD, not
   determinism.
4. **58 gate call sites hardcode phase 4** for the parameterized `STA1214`, several already wrong
   (`Promise.${method}` belongs to Phase 5 step 11 under `STA1216`; `an async method` to Phase 5).
5. **`STA1214`'s table row claimed Phase 3**, which is meaningless for a code whose message names
   the phase per construct — and Phase 3 is closed.

**Fixes.** Phase 4 gets an explicit **exit criterion** listing the members whose blocker it owns,
with the residue assigned by blocker rather than by whichever phase was open: `matchAll` splits from
`match` (it answers an iterator → Phase 5 step 8) while `exec`/`match` stay Phase 4 (an ARRAY WITH
PROPERTIES, which is Task 4.1's hybrid extended to arrays — the gate comment already named this);
`STA1208` → Phase 5 step 9 and `STA1207` → step 10, both new steps with their blockers spelled out;
`Date` joins Task 4.2's list explicitly; the descriptor/prototype surface goes to Phase 8 where
`STA1204` already sits. Task 4.2 gains a **determinism carve-out** — nondeterministic members land
with a range/property proof and are marked in the dashboard, not counted missing forever. New
**Task 4.7** walks all 58 hardcoded pointers and adds the test that would have caught this class
without anyone reading a table: a not-yet diagnostic must not name a phase already marked complete.
Phase 5 is retitled "`js` mode, and the language surface Phase 4 deferred", because steps 8–11 are
not `js`-mode work and pretending otherwise is how a phase becomes a bucket.

**Rule added to the plan (§7, and it generalizes).** A `not-yet` diagnostic names the phase that
owns its **blocker**, never the phase that happens to be open. When a phase closes, every code
naming it is either delivered or reassigned in that same change.

**Also fixed while here:** `docs/TOOLCHAIN.md` claimed Ryū was vendored at `runtime/vendor/ryu/`.
It is not, and never was — entry 28 records why, and `runtime/vendor/` contains only `quickjs-ng`.
The line now says so and points at entry 28.

**plan.md edited:** yes — §7 (exit criterion, Task 4.2 carve-out and `Date`, new Task 4.7), §8
(retitle, step 8 corrected from "three surfaces" to four, new steps 9–11), §16 (v2.2 resumes the log
for Phases 2–4, v2.3 records the `done.md` split and this change).

## 118. Phase-4 completion records must not duplicate the active roadmap (2026-09-01)

**Review.** The Phase 1–3 records had been reduced to the required task-number/title stubs in
`plan.md`, but four already-landed Phase-4 records (Tasks 4.3–4.6) still repeated their completion
status and evidence there even though their full narratives already lived in `done.md`. That made the
open roadmap ambiguous about whether those tasks still had work.

**Resolution.** Replaced the duplicate Task 4.3–4.6 narratives with struck-through stubs pointing to
`done.md`. Task 4.1 remains active: fixed and dynamic objects are archived, but the Phase-4 exit
still needs arrays carrying match properties for `RegExp.prototype.exec` and
`String.prototype.match`. Task 4.2 remains active: `pnpm run test:builtins` currently reports
**131/197** members, with Math 21/43 and Object 6/13 among its open surface. No task was marked done
without its Check.

## 119. Math transcendental slice completed and dashboard synchronized (2026-09-01)

**Implementation/check.** Vendored fdlibm now backs the remaining Math transcendental wrappers, with
V8-compatible binary/degenerate `hypot` handling and a deterministic xorshift `Math.random` proof.
The new `tests/golden/ts/math_transcendental.ts` matches Node byte-for-byte; the unit range/
variation test proves `Math.random` under the determinism carve-out.

**Plan/dashboard update.** Added the transcendental fixture claims and nondeterministic proof to
`tests/golden/builtins_coverage.json`; `pnpm run test:builtins` now reports **152/196** deterministic
members (Math **42/42**, plus one carved proof). Phase 4 Task 4.2 remains open for Object, Date,
console, and the RegExp array-properties blocker.

## 120. Arrays carry a property table; `exec` and `match` land (2026-09-01)

**The blocker, restated.** Phase 4's exit criterion named one item Phase 4 owned and had not built:
an **array with properties**. ECMA-262 §22.2.7.2 builds `exec`'s answer as an array of the capture
groups that ALSO carries `index`, `input` and `groups` on it, and `console.log` prints all three —
`[ '12-ab', '12', 'ab', index: 0, input: '12-ab', groups: undefined ]`. A dense `JSRTArray` had
`length`/`capacity`/`elements` and nothing else, so `exec`, `String.prototype.match` and the
`STA1211` family sat behind it (`docs/SUBSET.md`, `src/frontend/gate.ts`).

**Resolution: one property table, two receivers.** `JSRTArray` gained the dynamic object's own
layout — `shape` + out-of-line `slots` + `slot_capacity` — and `jsrt_shape.c` now drives both
through a `PropTable` view, so `m.index` resolves through the same shape chain and the same per-site
inline cache an `o.x` does. Reuse, not a parallel implementation: a cache filled at one site stays
valid however the value was built. `shape == NULL` is "no properties", so every ordinary array pays
one NULL word and no allocation. `jsrt_dyn_property_count`/`_order` became
`jsrt_shape_property_count`/`_order`, keyed off the shape alone, because the printer and
`Object.keys` now have two kinds of owner to ask.

**Three things the spec forced that a smaller slice would have got wrong.**

1. **`groups` has a NULL PROTOTYPE**, and Node's inspector says so: `[Object: null prototype]
   { year: '2026' }`. Printing it as a plain `{ … }` would have been a byte-for-byte golden failure
   dressed up as a passing test, so a second class descriptor (`jsrt_class_null_proto`, identical to
   `jsrt_class_dynamic` in every field that means anything and distinct by ADDRESS) marks them, and
   `jsrt_is_dynobj` answers true for both.
2. **A capture that did not participate is `undefined` IN the array**, not a missing element —
   `group_value` already answered that for `split`, and the match array reuses it.
3. **`lre_get_groupnames`' stride is `strlen(name) + LRE_GROUP_NAME_TRAILER_LEN`, which is 2**, not
   1: each entry is a NUL-terminated name followed by a scope byte. Striding by one lands mid-entry
   and silently loses every name after the first — caught only because the runtime print corpus
   diffs against Node, which is exactly what that corpus is for.

**The typing decision: the match is Unknown, and that is honest.** `exec` answers
`RegExpExecArray | null`. The HIR has no union, so the node's type is Unknown and the verdict is
`dynamic` — a match array is NOT given an HType. Two routes were considered and rejected:

- Mapping `RegExpExecArray` to `array<string>` and letting the existing narrowing machinery insert a
  boundary check requires adding `array` to `CHECKABLE` in `src/frontend/narrowing.ts`. That set is
  deliberately `number | string | boolean` — a tag test cannot settle an element type, and admitting
  arrays would silently widen EVERY `unknown → T[]` narrowing in the language (`JSON.parse(t) as
  string[]` included), which is a soundness decision this task has no evidence to make.
- Giving the match array its own HType kind spreads a fourth structural type through the type model,
  the verifier and every pass, to describe one builtin's answer.

What landed instead is the discipline every other builtin surface already follows: a closed table
(`MATCH_FIELDS` in `src/hir/nodes.ts` — `index`, `input`, `groups`, `length`), one HIR node
(`MatchRead`, verifier `STA4089`), and the CHECKER as the proof that a receiver is a match
(`isMatchReceiver`, exactly how `isStringReceiver` proves a string). `m[0]` indexes it like the
dense array it is — the verifier already admitted an Unknown index target; only the gate's
`checker.isArrayType` test had to learn about it. No boundary check is inserted on these reads and
none is owed: the RUNTIME produced the values, so there is no annotation crossing a boundary to
doubt, and a receiver that is not a match panics inside `jsrt_get_prop` rather than being misread.

**What this does NOT close.** `m.map`, `m.slice`, spreading a match — anything needing the match to
have an HIR type — is `not-yet(STA1214, Phase 5)`, the union work. `STA1211` survives, with a
narrower meaning: the DATA property surface (`source`, `flags`, `lastIndex`, `global`, …) plus
`toString`/`compile`, which need reads the object model has no node for. `String.prototype.matchAll`
stays Phase 5 step 8 — it answers an ITERATOR, which is why it split from `match` in the first place
(plan-notes 116).

**Check.** `pnpm run ci` — 297 unit tests, 257 subset fixtures (192 passed / 65 expected-fail / 0
failed), 85 golden fixtures both modes, runtime print corpus matches Node, ASan/UBSan clean.
`pnpm run test:builtins`: **154/196** (was 152), `String.prototype` 31/32 (only `matchAll` left),
`RegExp.prototype` 2/15 — and the 13 remaining there are all data properties, none of them blocked
on this.

**plan.md edited:** yes — §7 Task 4.1 closed and moved to `done.md`; Task 4.2's residue and the
phase exit criterion's RegExp bullet updated to say the blocker is gone.

## 121. `RegExp.prototype`'s data properties, and the two members that stay out (2026-09-01)

**Task:** plan.md §7 Task 4.2, the residue the phase exit criterion names as `RegExp.prototype`'s
DATA property surface — the thing left after Task 4.1 closed the array-with-properties blocker.

**What it is.** Eleven properties (§22.2.6) and `toString`, all DERIVED: `source` and `flags` are
two strings on `JSRTRegExp`, `lastIndex` is a header field, and the eight flag predicates are one
bit test each against `lre_flags`. Nothing here is state the compiler has to keep in step, and
nothing needed a new representation — which is why this was never blocked on Task 4.1 and why the
exit criterion was right to call it "reads the object model has no node for" rather than a gap.

**The shape.** Two closed tables side by side rather than one: `REGEXP_OPS` (methods — a callee and
nothing else) and the new `REGEXP_FIELDS` (data — a read and nothing else). They were not merged,
though a data property is arguably a nullary method: `toString` and `source` are both arity 0, so a
single table could not tell `re.toString()` from `re.source` without a `form` discriminant, which is
two tables wearing one name. One HIR node (`regexp-read`), one verifier code (**STA4090**), the
`MatchRead` shape with the receiver pinned the other way — a regexp IS concretely typed, so the
verifier pins the receiver as it does a `RegExpOp`'s, where a match read has to pin it Unknown.

**The bug this found.** `re->flags` stored the flag string AS WRITTEN. §22.2.6.4 builds it in the
canonical `d g i m s u v y` order, and Node normalizes everywhere: `/a/ig` has `.flags === "gi"` and
PRINTS as `/a/gi`. The old `console.log(/a/ig)` therefore disagreed with Node on any literal whose
flags were out of order — a live golden-output bug that no fixture happened to write. Fixed at the
single place that can fix it, `jsrt_regexp_new`, so `flags`, `toString` and `inspect` read one
normalized string and cannot drift apart. `tests/golden/ts/regexp.ts`'s "carried verbatim" comment
was describing the bug and is corrected.

**Three members that do NOT land, each for a different reason — none of them "later":**

- **`lastIndex` as a WRITE.** `re.lastIndex = 0` is how a program restarts a /g scan, and it is not
  the read spelled backwards: it is an assignment TARGET, and `isAssignableTarget` admits an
  identifier, an element access, and a field of a CLASS — nothing else. Lowering the read into a
  store to make the spelling work would put a builtin's mutable state behind a node that was never
  designed to carry it. Refused by name (STA1214), pinned by a decision test in both modes.
- **`unicodeSets`.** In the table, unreachable in this project: the property is declared in
  `lib.es2024.regexp.d.ts` and `tsconfig.json` pins `lib: ["es2023"]`, so the CHECKER refuses the
  read before the gate sees it. Raising `lib` is a subset-wide scope change (it admits every other
  ES2024 addition at the same time) and is not this task's to make. It stays in `REGEXP_FIELDS`
  because the table describes the SPEC surface and the runtime already handles /v; the dashboard
  counts it missing, which is the honest answer.
- **`compile`.** Annex B §B.2.4 legacy — the only builtin that RECOMPILES a regexp in place — with
  an optional second argument that a fixed-`arity` op table cannot express. Keeps STA1211.

**Dashboard:** `RegExp.prototype` 2/15 → **13/15**, missing exactly `compile` and `unicodeSets`.
Total 154/196 → 165/196.

**Codes allocated:** STA4090 (verifier: a `regexp-read`'s receiver or result type), STA4091
(runtime: a flag letter outside `dgimsuvy`, STA4084-style — the emitter having invented a property).

**plan.md edited:** yes — Task 4.2's residue no longer lists the RegExp data properties, and the
phase exit criterion's `RegExp.prototype` bullet now names `compile` and `unicodeSets` with the
reasons above, neither of which Phase 4 owns.

## 122. The platform matrix found two real bugs on its first run (2026-09-01)

**Task:** the CI workflow's platform × arch matrix (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), decomposed into
five parallel jobs — `static` once, `frontend` on six platform/arch pairs, and `runtime`, `asan`
and `intl` on the four Unix ones.

**It was not a formality.** The matrix went red on its first run for two reasons, both real, both
invisible on the machine this project is developed on:

1. **`-lm` was never linked.** macOS puts libm in libSystem, so a Darwin-only history never needed
   the flag; glibc keeps it separate, and every Linux link failed on `floor`, `fmod`, `trunc`,
   `sqrt` and `round` — ToInt32, array indexing and the print path all call one. Fixed as
   `SYS_LIBS` in `runtime/Makefile`, applied to the test-program rules AND to `link-flags.txt`,
   because `src/cli/build.ts` reads that file to link the EMITTED program: without it, `stator
   build` on Linux would have failed for any program that indexes an array, which is every program.
   The flag is a no-op on macOS, so there is no host conditional.
2. **UB in `out_units` (`runtime/src/jsrt_regexp.c`).** `memcpy(o->units + o->len, src, 0)` while
   `o->units` is still NULL: both `NULL + 0` and a zero-length `memcpy` with a null argument are
   undefined (C11 §7.24.1p2). Appending nothing is a real case — an empty replacement, a `$&` for a
   zero-length match, the tail after a match ending at the last unit — so the fix is an early
   return, not a guard at one call site. Reported by UBSan on macOS CI and NOT by the local ASan
   run, which is the whole argument for running the sanitizer job on more than one host.

**What this says about the local gate.** `pnpm run ci` passing is necessary and was never
sufficient: it proves one OS, one arch, one libc, one sanitizer build. The workflow's job map (a
comment at the top of `ci.yml`) is what keeps the two from drifting apart — every step of the
serial local chain names the parallel job that inherited it.

**plan.md edited:** no. Nothing here changes the roadmap; both fixes are defects in landed work.

## 123. Phase 0's gate is closed — the owner approved the niche (2026-09-01)

**Decision:** the repository owner approved `NICHE.md` by name, quoting its own title: "Stator
niche decision — explicit static/dynamic policy for tooling binaries". Recorded, not granted — the
gate says an agent must not self-approve it (plan.md §3 Task 0.1 step 4), and this entry exists so
that the approval has a dated record independent of the tag.

**What was approved.** The niche as written: small standalone developer-tool and worker binaries
migrating from JavaScript to strict TypeScript, under an explicit two-mode policy over ONE module
graph — `--mode=ts` strict and unapologetic about it, `--mode=js` accepting the untyped residue and
marking it dynamic, with runtime checks at every JS→typed-TS boundary and `stator explain --json`
reporting which constructs stayed static. The competitor that almost serves it is scriptc, and the
difference claimed is narrow and honest: scriptc's contract is construct-level static compilation
with an embedded QuickJS-NG fallback; Stator's is two auditable source-POLICY modes in the same
graph with typed/dynamic provenance carried through HIR.

**Two conditions ride with it**, both already in the file and now normative: scriptc is
re-evaluated QUARTERLY before further investment, and reopening this decision needs §15.4's bar —
new measured evidence recorded here — not a change of mind. The file also keeps its own
disqualifier: if the real requirement is extensible end-user scripting, embed an engine and do not
use Stator.

**Sequencing.** Phase 1 ran ahead of this gate on explicit owner instruction, recorded at the time
as an exception under §15.1 rather than as a reinterpretation of it. Closing the gate makes that
exception moot rather than retroactively correct — the rule that no phase may be entered without
its gate is unchanged.

**Actions taken:** `NICHE.md` status header updated from "proposed" to approved with the date and
the approving words; §3's status block flipped from ⏳ STILL OPEN to ✅ CLOSED with a pointer to
`done.md`; the stale "Phase 0 remains open" clause under Phase 1's open follow-up corrected; the
completion record added to `done.md` → Phase 0. The commit carrying `NICHE.md` is tagged
`phase-0-approved`, which is what Task 0.1's machine-verifiable Check reads.

**plan.md edited:** yes — §3 status and the Task 0.1 stub; the five steps stay in `plan.md` because
they are the gate's definition and §15.1 points at them.

## 124. Phase 4's exit criterion demanded three members no golden test can hold (2026-09-01)

**Found by:** reviewing the roadmap on owner instruction, not by a failing test — which is the point.

**The defect.** §7's exit criterion listed `console` as `table`, `time`, `timeEnd`, `trace`. Task
4.2's bar is "a builtin counts as implemented when ≥1 golden test exercises it and matches Node
byte-for-byte". `console.time`/`timeEnd` print an elapsed DURATION and `console.trace` prints a
STACK — neither is a function of the program's input, so no golden test can hold either to Node.
The criterion therefore could not be met, and Phase 4 could not close, for reasons that had nothing
to do with the work remaining.

This is the SAME defect plan-notes 116 identified and fixed for `Math.random`, `Date.now()` and
zero-argument `new Date()`. The carve-out it created was correct and is unchanged; it simply was
never applied to console, because the exit criterion was written from the dashboard's
missing-members list rather than from the reasons those members were missing. `done.md`'s console
addendum had already recorded the right reasoning on 2026-08-30 — "deferred, and for a reason that
will not change" — so the two documents disagreed for two days with the archive being the correct
one, which is exactly the failure mode §15.3 exists to prevent.

**The fix.** `time`, `timeEnd` and `trace` move under the existing determinism carve-out: they land
with a shape assertion in `tests/unit/` (the label is echoed, a duration is printed, the unit is
`ms`) and are marked `nondeterministic` in `builtins_coverage.json` rather than counted against
coverage. The bar is unchanged for every member that CAN be pinned to Node.

**`table` is deliberately NOT carved out.** Its column layout is a pure function of the data it is
given — same input, same box-drawing characters, same widths — so it is ordinary Phase 4 work and
stays in the exit criterion. Carving out the whole namespace because three of its four members are
untestable would have hidden a real gap behind a real exemption.

**Rule this reinforces:** an exit criterion is written from BLOCKERS, never from a list of what is
currently red. A criterion assembled from a dashboard inherits every reason a member is missing,
including the reasons that will never change (plan-notes 116's rule, applied one level up).

**plan.md edited:** yes — §7's `console` bullet in the phase exit criterion.

## 125. `Object`'s remaining four were four different problems, not one (2026-09-01)

**Context.** Phase 4's exit criterion listed `assign`, `create`, `freeze`, `isFrozen` under one
justification: "shape work, on Task 4.1's machinery." Building them found that exactly one of the
four is shape work.

**Evidence.**

1. **`assign` is shape work, and landed.** Two-argument form, target restricted to a growable
   shape. `grep -rn "jsrt_throw" runtime/src/*.c src/codegen/*.ts` shows the write path needs no
   exception, and the golden fixture matches Node byte-for-byte.

2. **`freeze`/`isFrozen` are blocked on RUNTIME-RAISED EXCEPTIONS, not on a frozen bit.** The bit is
   trivial. The problem is what a write to a frozen object must do: §10.4.7 makes it a `TypeError`,
   and ES modules are always strict, so silently dropping the write is not an available reading.
   The runtime cannot raise one. `jsrt_throw` sets a pending cell, and every one of its three call
   sites is in `src/codegen/index.ts`, two of them literally `jsrt_throw(...); goto <pad>` — the
   pad is emitted per-function by codegen, so a library function has nothing to jump to.
   `runtime/src/` calls `jsrt_throw` zero times. `jsrt_panic` (abort) is the only tool a builtin
   has, and aborting turns a legal program into a crash.

   This was already recorded, twice, by people who were not looking for it: `docs/SUBSET.md`'s
   `JSON.stringify` row says a cycle aborts because "the spec throws TypeError, which builtins
   cannot raise yet", and `jsrt_value.h`'s `jsrt_call` comment says calling a non-function is fatal
   "until ... the runtime exceptions". Two independent notes of the same missing mechanism, and the
   exit criterion still assigned work that needs it to the phase that does not build it.

   Phase 5 step 11 builds it — "a handler's throw must become a rejection, which needs a
   runtime-level catch around user code" is the same mechanism under a different motivation.
   `freeze`/`isFrozen` move there.

3. **`create` is prototype machinery, and is `any`.** `lib.es5.d.ts` declares
   `create(o: object | null): any`, which ts mode rejects before any subset question is reached.
   And its one in-subset spelling, `Object.create(null)`, asks for a prototype-less object — which
   every object in both layouts already is, since neither has a reachable prototype. It is
   `STA1204`'s Phase 8 surface, where `getPrototypeOf`/`setPrototypeOf` already are.

**A stale pointer found on the way.** `jsrt_value.h`'s comment named **Phase 6** as the deliverer of
runtime exceptions. Phase 6 is conformance and differential fuzzing; the mechanism moved when
plan-notes 116 restructured the phases, and the comment did not. Corrected to Phase 5 step 11.

**Decision.** Phase 4's `Object` bullet is now `assign` alone. `freeze`/`isFrozen` → Phase 5 step
11; `create` → Phase 8 with `STA1204`.

**The rule this is the second instance of.** Note 124 found an exit criterion written from a list of
what was red rather than from the reasons. This is the same defect one level in: four members
grouped under one justification that fitted one of them. **A criterion that names members must name
each member's blocker, because that is the only thing that says which phase owns it** — grouping
hides exactly the mismatch that makes a phase unexitable. Checked the rest of the criterion under
this rule while here: the `console` bullet (note 124) and the `Math` bullet each now carry a
per-member reason, and no other bullet groups members under a shared justification.

## 126. Architecture diagrams added as docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (2026-09-01)

**Request.** Owner asked for a UML diagram of how Stator works, wired into AGENTS.md, plan.md, and
docs/.

**What landed.** `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: Mermaid renderings of plan §2 — the compile pipeline
(component view), a `stator build` invocation (sequence view), `src/` module dependencies with the
two structural invariants (`ts.Type` stops at frontend; mode stops at the gate), and value flow at
a type boundary (raw vs NaN-boxed, STA2001). Mermaid because GitHub renders it natively — no
tooling, no image files to drift.

**Plan edit.** §2's "fixed" repo layout lists docs/ files, so adding a doc file is a plan edit:
`ARCHITECTURE.md` added to that list and to AGENTS.md's repo map, plus one line in §2 stating the
diagrams visualize that section and are never an authority over it — same subordination rule as
MODES.md/SUBSET.md to §1. No spec content changed; the doc is derived, not normative.

## 127. The two open Phase-4 tasks get detailed Steps; the audit behind them (2026-09-01)

**What changed.** plan.md Task 4.2 gained two step lists (`Date`; `console.table` + the
`time`/`timeEnd`/`trace` carve-out trio), Task 4.7 gained Steps and its own Check, and the
exit-criterion `Date` bullet was rewritten per-member (the rule note 125 established). Evidence:
a five-agent audit of the working tree at `39cf053` plus measurements against the pinned Node
v26.7.0 (which the active `node` matches exactly).

**Task 4.7's count was stale.** The task said "58 call sites hardcode phase 4"; at `39cf053` the
audit counts **63** — 60 `notYet(…, 4)` (all `STA1214`) plus two `STA1211` literals
(gate.ts:1207, 2101) and one `STA1215` (gate.ts:1116). The RegExp-properties and Object.assign
slices landed after the original count. Grouping: 2 sites are purely Phase 5 step 8 (their own
comments name the iterator protocol), 2 purely step 11 (the Promise property-access pair — the
call-side Promise sites already say phase 5, but as `STA1214` while the plan assigns the surface
to `STA1216`; the code question is now an explicit step), 8 are catch-alls straddling several
owners (one hardcoded phase cannot be right for them — they need member-level splits), and **51
fit no group the plan names** (7 module-surface, 32 arity/spread/argument-shape refinements, 5
method-as-value, 4 Math/JSON residues, 2 dedicated `STA1211` + 1 `STA1215`). Assigning those 51 a
phase mechanically would recreate the lie the task exists to remove, so the step list makes "give
the blocker an owner by plan edit" part of the task. Also found: nothing in `src/` knows which
phases are complete and `gate.test.ts` never reads the `phase` field — the regression test the
task demands has no substrate, so building one (a completed-phases constant in `src/support/`) is
now step 2. `STA1215` carries `phase: 4` while its DIAGNOSTICS row says the message names a build
flag, not a phase — sentinel exemption is step 3. The async-method example the task named as wrong
was already fixed to phase 5 before this audit.

**Date slicing is forced by determinism, measured, not assumed.** With TZ=UTC vs
TZ=America/New_York on the pinned Node: `toISOString`/`toJSON`/`toUTCString`/`getTime`/the
`getUTC*` family/`Date.UTC`/ISO `Date.parse` are byte-identical (slice A); the local getters/
setters/`getTimezoneOffset`/`new Date(y,m,…)` differ by TZ (slice B — legal only after the golden
runner pins `TZ=UTC`; today all three `spawnSync` calls in tests/golden/run.ts inherit the
machine's environment); `toString` embeds an ICU CLDR long zone name ("(Coordinated Universal
Time)"), which puts the `toString` family and `toLocale*` with Task 4.4's intl feature build.
`console.log(new Date(0))` prints the ISO string — TZ-independent, so Date values are golden-safe
to print. Two divergences are documented rather than papered over: `Date.parse` is ISO-grammar
only (non-ISO answers `NaN`, which §21.4.3.2 permits; Node's non-ISO heuristics are TZ-dependent
and implementation-defined — pinned by a runtime unit test, never a golden fixture), and
`toISOString` on an Invalid Date panics until Phase 5 step 11 delivers runtime-raised exceptions
(the `freeze`/`isFrozen` precedent). `Date.now`/zero-arg `new Date()` go the `Math.random`
carve-out road. Dashboard: `Date` is absent from builtins_coverage.json entirely; adding the
namespaces is a JSON-only change (the runner iterates namespaces dynamically).

**console.table ground truth captured from the pinned Node** (it changed across Node majors:
v26.7.0 left-aligns with one-space padding, `(index)`/`Values` headers, key-union columns in
first-seen order, blank missing cells, inspect-quoted strings, header-only table for `[]`,
console.log fallback for non-tabular input, no ANSI when piped). Two scope cuts recorded:
the optional `properties` argument is refused (joins 4.7's refinement group for an owner), and v1
width counting is code points, not wcwidth display columns — non-ASCII cells may misalign vs Node
(which uses a wcwidth-style `getStringWidth`); the ceiling is named in SUBSET.md and a code
comment. One trap the steps encode: output must route through `write_grouped`, because Node
indents tables inside `console.group`. And the carve-out trio (`time`/`timeEnd`/`trace`) is NOT
implemented today (absent from `CONSOLE_METHODS`) — note 124 moved their *proof* to the
carve-out, but the members still must land; that is now an explicit step.

**Also confirmed.** The working tree's uncommitted changes are the complete, coherent
Object.assign slice plan.md records as landed 2026-09-01 (typecheck passes) plus this session's
ARCHITECTURE.md rider — the new steps build on that state and touch none of it.

## 128. `console.table` — measured first, then built (2026-09-01)

> Renumbered from 126 (2026-09-01): two sessions appended entries the same day and both picked
> 126/127 — the second occurrence of the note-115 defect. This pair was the later append; see 130.

**Why this one needed measuring.** Every other console method is a formatting rule with one shape.
`table` is a layout ALGORITHM, and the spec (WHATWG console, "table") describes what it means, not
what it draws. The only authority on the bytes is Node. So the first step was not design, it was
`node -e`-equivalent probes over ten shapes: array of objects, mixed rows, object argument, array
rows, empty, wide cells, nested inspect cells, scalar, `Map`, `Set`, and a table inside a group.

**What the probes settled**, none of which was guessable:

- A cell is a space, the content, padding to the column width, then a space — so a divider segment
  is always the width plus two.
- Column order is FIRST-SEEN across rows, with `Values` appended last if any row was not an object.
- A missing key is an EMPTY cell, not `undefined`.
- Cells are inspect form (`'x'` quoted) but the index LABEL is not (`r1`, not `'r1'`) — a key is
  not a value.
- An ARRAY row contributes its indices as column names, so `[[1,2]]` tables under `0` and `1`.
- A non-collection argument falls back to `console.log` — `console.table('scalar')` prints `scalar`.
- A `Map` gets an `(iteration index)` column and a `Key` column; a `Set` gets `(iteration index)`
  and `Values`. **A different table, not a wider one.**

**What landed.** Arrays and plain objects, both modes, held byte-for-byte by
`tests/golden/{ts,js}/console_builtins.*`. The runtime reuses what was already there rather than
re-deriving it: cells go through `inspect_value` (so a table cell and an array element can never
format differently), rows through `jsrt_object_entries` (so column order and `Object.entries` can
never disagree), and the finished grid through `write_grouped` (so the group indent applies to
every line of the table for free, which the fixture proves).

**What did not, and why by name.** The Map/Set form is refused at the gate (`STA1214`). Drawing it
means a second table shape, and a runtime that guessed at it would print something Node does not —
the failure mode a golden test exists to prevent. Refusing is the honest half.

**One ceiling, marked in the source.** Padding is by DISPLAY width, and `cell_width` implements
`getStringWidth`'s rule for the code points a cell in this subset can hold — continuation bytes
never count, combining marks count zero, East-Asian Wide and Fullwidth count two. The full Unicode
width table is not reproduced; a cell holding one of the rarer wide blocks pads one column narrow,
which misaligns a row rather than corrupting it. Named in the comment so the next person hits a
note rather than a mystery.

**Phase 4's `console` bullet is now the three carve-out proofs alone.** `time`/`timeEnd`/`trace`
were moved there by note 124 for a reason that does not change; `table` was the one member of that
bullet a golden test could ever hold, and it holds.

## 129. The carve-out's second use, and what it is actually for (2026-09-01)

> Renumbered from 127 (2026-09-01) — same collision as 128; see 130.

**Landed.** `console.time`, `console.timeEnd` and `console.trace`, proved by
`tests/unit/console-carveout.test.ts`. `console` now reads `12/12 (100%) [+3 nondeterministic]`,
and Phase 4's `console` exit-criterion bullet is ✅ MET.

**What the proof asserts, and why each assertion is there.** The carve-out is not permission to
skip a test; note 116 defined it as a DIFFERENT test, and the dashboard's checker verifies a
carved member's proof exactly as hard as a golden one (the file must exist and must mention it).
So each assertion is aimed at a specific way of faking the member:

- The label is echoed and the unit is `ms` — a shape a stub can pass, and the baseline the plan
  named ("the label is echoed, a duration is printed, the unit is `ms`").
- Two timers produce TWO lines, not four — `console.time` printing nothing is part of the contract.
- Three million adds measure longer than nothing — this is the one a constant-returning stub
  cannot pass. Magnitude is not assertable; ORDERING is.
- `trace` writes to stderr and stdout stays empty — the half of `trace` that IS reproducible.

**Two behaviours that came out of measuring Node rather than reading the spec.** Re-timing a label
that is already running keeps the ORIGINAL start (Node warns and does not restart), and
`timeEnd` on a label that was never started writes nothing to stdout. The second follows the rule
`console.countReset` already set: Node warns, this runtime has no warning channel, and the
observable stdout is identical either way.

**`trace` prints no frames, deliberately.** Node follows the prefix with a stack; this runtime has
no unwinder. `jsrt_uncaught` had already faced this exact choice and taken the same answer — its
comment says the text "intentionally does not chase Node's (which prints source excerpts and stack
frames this runtime does not have); the OBSERVABLE contract is stderr + exit 1." Fabricating frames
would make the output look right and be wrong, which is the failure mode every golden test in this
repo exists to prevent.

**Node's unit ladder is reproduced, not simplified.** Milliseconds below a second, `s` below a
minute, `m:ss.mmm` above one. The VALUE cannot match Node, but the FORMAT can, and a ten-minute
build printing `600000.000ms` would differ from Node in a way that is not the measurement's fault.
This is the line the carve-out draws in general: carve out what the machine decides, keep
everything the format decides.

## 130. A same-day race: the console work landed while its steps were being written (2026-09-01)

**What happened.** Two sessions worked this repo concurrently on 2026-09-01. One wrote detailed
Steps into plan.md for Task 4.2's remainder (`Date`, `console.table`, the carve-out trio) and
Task 4.7, grounded in a five-agent evidence audit at `39cf053` (note 127). The other implemented
`console.table` and the trio, committing `0ef7724` — which also swept the first session's
uncommitted plan edits into history. Result: plan.md briefly instructed work that was already
done, and plan-notes gained two entries numbered 126 and two numbered 127.

**Resolutions, in the order applied.**
1. **Numbering.** Second occurrence of the note-115 defect (append without checking the tail).
   Per that precedent the later pair renumbered: console.table → **128**, carve-out trio →
   **129**, with renumber banners left in place and the one inbound reference (plan.md's console
   exit bullet) repointed. Note 127 (the steps audit) keeps its number — plan.md references it
   four times.
2. **plan.md.** The console step list is replaced by a landed record pointing at 128/129; the
   Task 4.2 "still open" line now names `Date` alone; §16 v2.6 records the reconciliation. Two
   residues the steps had flagged stay open and are preserved in the record: the optional
   `properties` argument (Task 4.7's refinement group) and the `Map`/`Set` tabular form
   (`STA1214`, deferred by name in 128's landing).
3. **The count dispute is resolved in the audit's favor.** A low-cost verification pass challenged
   note 127's "63 sites" as impossible, counting 53–57 — but its method was a single-line
   `grep 'notYet.*4)'`, and many `notYet(…)` calls span lines. A multiline-aware recount
   (regex over the file, not per-line) of the post-`0ef7724` tree finds **61** `notYet(…, 4)`
   + 2 `STA1211` + 1 `STA1215` = 64, consistent with 63 at `39cf053` plus the console slices.
   The lesson is already encoded as Task 4.7 step 1: the number moves; enumerate, never assume —
   and enumerate with a parser-shaped tool, not a line grep. The same pass DID catch one real
   defect: the step list cited "plan-notes 117", an entry that does not exist (the numbering jumps
   116 → 118); the console single-table plumbing note is **94**. That citation died with the
   replaced step list — and the sweep for other "117" citations found a pre-existing one in
   `gate.ts`'s Math-surface comment, fixed to **119** (the fdlibm entry that actually completed
   the surface).

**Standing fix for the collision class.** Before appending an entry, read the last heading and
take max+1 — and when two sessions may be active, expect the tail to move between reading and
committing. This note is itself numbered by that rule.

**Amended 2026-09-01, after the third occurrence** (both 133s — see 137). "Renumber the later
append" was a proxy for the thing that actually matters, and it is the wrong proxy when the later
entry is the one everything cites: **renumber whichever duplicate has FEWER inbound references**,
then repoint those and leave a banner on the moved entry. In that collision the later entry (Date
slice B) had eight references across four files including a C source comment, and the earlier had
one — so the later one kept 133. Cascading renumbers stay forbidden either way: 134/135/136 were
already cited by commit messages, which cannot be edited.

## 131. Steps for every remaining phase, written against the tree rather than the task lines (2026-09-01)

**What changed.** `plan.md` had detailed Steps only where work was imminent: Phases 5–8 carried
task LINES (one paragraph each) but no executable steps, so "what is the next action" was
answerable only for Phase 4. All four now have numbered steps — Phase 5's eleven, Phase 6's three
task lists, Phase 7's three plus a phase preamble and an out-of-scope table, Phase 8's nine.
§16 gains **v2.7**.

**Method, and why it matters more than the length.** Every step was grounded by reading the current
tree, not by elaborating the task line. Done from the task lines alone, half of these steps would
describe work that is already finished or cannot work as written. What the reading changed:

1. **Phase 5 step 1 is mostly landed.** `src/frontend/program.ts` already wires `allowJs`/`checkJs`
   by mode, `src/hir/nodes.ts` already carries `provenance`, `src/lower/index.ts` has
   `provenanceOf`, and `src/cli/explain.ts` already prints `verdict (provenance)` per function. The
   step is now the **`inferred` middle grade** alone — lowering grades typed-vs-dynamic today, and
   step 5's boundary insertion keys on exactly the distinction that does not exist yet.
2. **Phase 5 step 5's proof shape was wrong.** A `.js` file whose JSDoc lies, caught at the boundary
   by `STA2001`, cannot be a Node-diff golden test: Node runs that program happily and prints the
   wrong answer, so "matches Node byte-for-byte" is the failure, not the pass. It needs an
   expected-stderr harness mode — recorded in the step so the first agent to reach it does not
   discover it by writing a fixture that cannot pass.
3. **Phase 5 step 11 is a contract change, not a builtin** — and specifically an EXTENSION of an
   existing contract, which the first draft of the step got wrong. `Promise.prototype.then` and
   `new Promise(executor)` both need a user closure's throw to become a rejection instead of
   unwinding into library C. The step originally called that a "protected call" and asked for a new
   `docs/VALUE.md` section; the verification pass found `VALUE.md` **§4.9 already defines the
   mechanism** — the pending cell and landing-pad protocol (`jsrt_throw` / `jsrt_pending` /
   `jsrt_take_exception`) — and `DIAGNOSTICS.md`'s own `STA1216` row already states the gap in one
   line: "the pending-exception protocol gives that catch to generated code, not to a builtin." So
   the step now asks for a SUBSECTION of §4.9 (a runtime-side call that checks `jsrt_pending()` on
   return and yields a completion value to the builtin) in §4.9's existing vocabulary. Inventing a
   second name for one mailbox is how a codebase ends up with two exception protocols. It also unlocks a
   backlog nobody had counted: `Object.freeze`/`isFrozen`, `toISOString` on an Invalid Date, and
   every `SUBSET.md` row reading "the spec throws, which builtins cannot raise yet" — those rows
   are IOUs written against this one mechanism, and the step says to grep for them and close or
   re-date each.
4. **Test262 cannot be vendored, and this environment cannot fetch it.** ~50k files, plus the
   no-network constraint of note 28 (the same one that deferred Ryū). So `tests/test262/` holds the
   runner and a pinned SHA; the corpus is git-ignored and fetched; a missing corpus **skips
   visibly** so `pnpm run ci` stays offline-runnable, and the CI job — not the `ci` chain — is what
   makes the number per-commit. Two anti-dishonesty rules are written in: an unmapped `features:`
   tag is a runner ERROR (otherwise a corpus bump inflates the skip bucket silently), and the pass
   rate is never printed without the skip count beside it.
5. **`tests/differential/` does not exist**, though `AGENTS.md`'s repo map names it — the map
   describes the target state. Step 1 of Task 6.2 creates it. The fuzzer is specified as
   type-directed (choose the type, then build an expression inhabiting it, so programs compile by
   construction) because a text-level generator would spend its budget rediscovering that
   unsupported syntax is unsupported; and seeded from a 10-line xorshift with **no** clock and no
   `Math.random`, so every finding replays from `--seed=N`.
6. **`tests/bench/record.ts` already exists and already gets the hard parts right** (best-of-5,
   because the minimum is the one number a scheduling hiccup cannot inflate; a `baseline.json` that
   stamps host, CPU, Node, clang, and the `-O2` string). Task 6.3 extends it rather than replacing
   it. Named traps: `ru_maxrss` is **KB on Linux, bytes on macOS** (a silent 1000× on the first
   cross-platform comparison), an absent engine must be recorded as `"absent"` rather than omitted,
   and the §12 perf gate's threshold must be measured from a same-commit double run before it is
   set — a gate below the noise floor trains people to ignore alarms.
7. **There is no scheduled workflow.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on push/PR only, so both the
   nightly fuzz and the weekly bench need a new `nightly.yml`; the seed comes from
   `github.run_number`, never the clock, so a nightly finding is replayable.
8. **Nothing under `src/frontend/` handles ambient `declare function`** — Phase 7 starts from new
   gate surface. The phase preamble now names the four things that make FFI four weeks rather than
   one line of C: pointers are invisible to Boehm for the duration of a call, UTF-16↔bytes is a
   real allocation so `string` maps to nothing implicitly, C reports errors by return value and
   never unwinds, and the two directions share only the ABI table. Two questions are marked as
   undeferrable: who owns a pointer after the call returns (borrowed or transferred — there is no
   third option the compiler can express), and what a C caller sees when an exported TS function
   throws (`stator_last_error` plus a sentinel, or abort — but a written choice either way, since
   an exception must never unwind into a C frame). An explicit out-of-scope table covers
   struct-by-value, varargs, C++, callbacks into closures, and threads. The generator's front end
   is provisionally `clang -Xclang -ast-dump=json` rather than libclang bindings: clang is already
   a hard requirement and the dependency budget is `typescript` only.
9. **QuickJS-NG is already partly vendored.** `runtime/vendor/quickjs-ng/VENDOR.md` pins `v0.16.2`
   (`1ab8676…`) for `libregexp`/`libunicode`. The interpreter ships its own copies, so Phase 8's
   vendoring step must take the **same commit** and extend the existing `VENDOR.md` — a second
   version, or a naive add of the full source beside the existing subset, is duplicate symbols at
   link time rather than a conflict any compiler will point at. Phase 8's first two steps are also
   marked as not-implementation: the human gate's evidence (named users, named blocked
   dependency — closed the way Phase 0's was, note 123), then the marshaling design doc, whose
   three questions are handles-not-copies, identity round-tripping (`x === x` across two
   crossings ⇒ a two-way handle table), and two collectors with a boundary-spanning cycle that
   leaks in v0 — a ceiling to state, not to discover.

**Ordering note.** `plan.md` §16's log is ascending; v2.7 was first appended above v2.6 and moved.
Trivial, but the same slip in a step list would put a dependency after its dependent.

**No agents were used for this pass** (owner instruction). Everything above came from direct reads
of the tree — which is also why the corrections in items 1, 5, and 9 exist: they are the kind of
"already landed" / "does not exist" / "already vendored" facts a plan-only pass cannot see.

## 132. `Date` slice A: what the plan's steps got right, and the four places the tree corrected them (2026-09-01)

Slice A landed as written in plan §7 Task 4.2's Date steps 1–7: `H_DATE` + the `DATE_OPS`/
`DATE_STATICS` tables, `runtime/src/jsrt_date.c`, the print/JSON integration, the emitter arms,
goldens in both modes, and the dashboard rows. `pnpm run ci` is the evidence. Four things the
steps specified turned out differently once the code existed, and all four are recorded because
they are decisions, not typos.

**1. The zero-argument constructor needed no node kind.** Step 2 says `gateNew` opens for Date and
zero-arg is accepted; step 3 lists `'date-new'`/`'date-op'` node kinds. The obvious reading is a
`DateNew` whose argument is optional, and the first attempt did exactly that — which immediately
split `date-new` out of the four shared switch arms it otherwise rides (counting, emission,
rewriting, `explain`, verification), because every one of them destructures `expr.arg`
unconditionally. §21.4.2.1 step 2 defines `new Date()` as *the current time value*, so the lowering
desugars it to `new Date(Date.now())` instead: a `date-static` node sitting in the `arg` slot, zero
plumbing, and the spec's own definition rather than a paraphrase of it. The distinction that makes
this a desugaring and not padding: `new Date(undefined)` is an Invalid Date, so an absent argument
and an explicit `undefined` are different programs — which is why the desugaring is to an explicit
`now` call rather than to the undefined-literal every other optional position gets.

**2. `Date.UTC` takes 1–7 arguments, not 2–7.** Step 1 says "2–7 args". §21.4.3.4 defaults `month`
to 0, and the pinned TypeScript's `lib.es5.d.ts` declares every parameter after `year` optional, so
`Date.UTC(2024)` is legal both ways and Node answers `1704067200000`. The gate accepts it. Caught
by a gate unit test asserting the refusal the plan implied; the test was wrong, not the code.

**3. The `now` coverage marker had to wait for its proof.** Step 7 says the dashboard gains `now`
as a `{"nondeterministic": …}` marker. The marker is verified as hard as a golden claim — the file
it names must exist and must mention the member — so writing it before
`tests/unit/date-clock.test.ts` existed would have failed the dashboard rather than deferred it.
That is the carve-out working as designed (note 129): the marker is not a free pass, and the
ordering it forces is proof-then-marker, never the reverse.

**4. A code collision, found by reading rather than by a test.** The first draft of
`jsrt_date.c`'s receiver assertion panicked with `STA4085`, which `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md` had already
allocated to `JSON.stringify`'s verifier claim. Nothing would have caught this: a panic string is
not compared against anything, and both codes are internal errors nobody's test asserts. It is now
`STA4093`, allocated properly alongside the verifier's `STA4092`. The general lesson is the one
`AGENTS.md` already states — `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md` is the sole allocator — with the addition that
*runtime panic strings are diagnostics too*, and the file is the only place that can say a number
is free.

**What is deliberately NOT in slice A, and why each is not a gap.** `Date.parse` is ISO-only: Node's
non-ISO heuristics are TZ-dependent and implementation-defined, so a golden fixture over one would
pin this machine rather than the language. A date-time string with no offset is local time and
answers `NaN` for the same reason. `toISOString` on an Invalid Date aborts where the spec throws a
`RangeError` — a builtin cannot raise until Phase 5 step 11, the `Object.freeze` ceiling exactly.
And `toJSON` answers `null` for an Invalid Date though `lib.es5.d.ts` declares it `(): string`;
§21.4.4.37 and Node both say `null`, so the divergence is the lib's, it is documented in
`docs/SUBSET.md`, and it is what makes `JSON.stringify(new Date(NaN))` the string `"null"` rather
than an abort.

**`STA1210` is now a residue code**, the shape `STA1211` has for RegExp: it names one member at a
time rather than the class. What remains under it is slice B (local time, blocked on pinning `TZ`
in the golden runner — Phase 4's own step 8) and the `toString`/`toLocale*` family (ICU CLDR data,
Task 4.4's feature build). Per §15's rule, closing Phase 4 means every member still under it is
delivered or reassigned.

## 137. The optimization ladder gets details, and one rung dies of a measurement (2026-09-01)

> Renumbered from 133 (2026-09-01): third occurrence of the note-115 defect — two entries the same
> day both took 133 (this one and "Date slice B"). **This time the LATER entry kept the number**,

> moved — entries 110–114 are already out of sequence, so position is not the index. See 130's
> standing fix, amended.

`plan.md` §12 was eight table rows and four one-line practices — the only section of the plan with no
detail under it, written from research figures rather than from this tree. Details added per rung:
the entry criterion (nothing starts before Task 6.3's harness and its measured noise floor), the
discipline every rung shares (baseline on one host, revert what does not move the geomean and record
the non-gain, semantics never a variable, feature-flag anything that adds a build mode), and for each
row its actual precondition, its trap in this codebase, and its abort rule. Three of the corrections
are worth naming here because they change what the rows mean.

**Rung 1's premise does not hold for this runtime.** Boa's "5–15% from mimalloc" is an *object*-
allocator result. Here the object allocator is Boehm: `jsrt_gc_alloc` calls `GC_generic_malloc`
(`runtime/src/jsrt_gc.c`), which a swapped `malloc` never sees. What is left for an allocator swap is
the non-collected scratch (regexp captures and keys, shape key encoding, unicode buffers, JSON
digits, the `console.count`/`time` tables, Intl) plus the no-Boehm fallback where `jsrt_gc_alloc` *is*
`malloc`. So the rung is now conditional on profiling those sites, and ordered after rung 3 rather
than first if it survives at all.

**Rung 7 is measured out of the schedule.** V8's snapshot exists because V8 constructs a builtin
object graph at startup; Stator's `jsrt_init()` is a 48-bit-pointer probe plus `GC_INIT()`, and
builtins are dead-stripped C functions, not constructed objects — there is nothing to snapshot.
Measured 2026-09-01 on this machine (Apple M3 Max, Darwin 25.6, Apple clang 21.0.0, `-O2`, Boehm
build via `pkg-config bdw-gc`, Node v26.7.0; best of 15 spawns each, timed by `spawnSync` around
`process.hrtime.bigint()`), with `export {};` as the empty program and an empty `.mjs` for Node:

| program | best of 15 |
|---|---|
| `stator build` output, empty program (51,656 bytes) | **3.23 ms** |
| `node empty.mjs` | 27.04 ms |
| `/bin/true` (process-spawn floor) | 0.23 ms |

Roughly 3 ms of budget exists in total, most of it dynamic linking. The row's inherited "50–200 ms
class wins for CLI tools" is now recorded as **none available here**, effort **not scheduled**, and
the rung is gated on a profile showing a floor worth attacking. Per §15.5 this is a measurement, not
a quote: the numbers above were produced on this host and are re-measurable from the same three
programs. (The favourable half of the comparison — an 8× faster start than Node — is a *finding of
this measurement*, not a benchmark claim: it belongs to Task 6.3's harness before it is published
anywhere, per §15.5 and the §12 practice above it.)

**Two practices had no home and now point at one.** The perf-regression gate and the published
conformance number were listed in §12 as standing practices with no owning task; they are specified
in Task 6.3 step 7 and Task 6.1 steps 6–8 respectively, so §12 now cites those rather than restating
them. The per-module C split gained the same treatment in the opposite direction: it now names what
it would actually change (`emitC` returns one string, `linkExecutable` makes one `clang -O2` call)
and the cost it must be measured against (separate TUs lose cross-module inlining, which is the hole
rung 6's `-flto` fills).

No code changed; `plan.md` §12 and this entry are the whole diff.


## 133. Date slice B: the local-time inverse, and two plan corrections (2026-09-01)

**Context.** Date step 8 (plan §7 Task 4.2) — the local-time getters/setters, `getTimezoneOffset`
and the component constructor, behind a `TZ=UTC` pin on the golden runner.

**What the tree corrected in the plan.**

1. **`toDateString` is not ICU-blocked.** `docs/SUBSET.md`, `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md` and plan §7's
   exit criterion all grouped it with `toString`/`toTimeString`/`toLocale*` as needing ICU CLDR
   names. Measured against the pinned Node under `TZ=Europe/Berlin`:
   `toString()` → `Mon Jul 15 2024 14:00:00 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)`,
   `toTimeString()` → `14:00:00 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)`,
   `toDateString()` → `Mon Jul 15 2024`. The third has no zone name in it, so it is a pure
   local-calendar read and landed with slice B. The other two are confirmed ICU-blocked for a
   reason now measured rather than assumed: the same instant through libc `strftime` with `%Z`
   gives `(CEST)`, the abbreviation — Node's long display name comes from ICU. All three docs and
   the exit criterion were edited in the same change.

2. **Step 9's residue claim needed widening.** It asked that the residue under `STA1210` be "exactly
   the intl family". After slice B it is `toString`, `toTimeString`, the three `toLocale*` and the
   call form `Date()` — five members and a call form, of which only three are locale-dependent in
   the `Intl` sense. The honest predicate is *ICU-dependent*, not *intl*: `toString` and
   `toTimeString` need ICU's timezone display names without going near a locale API. The docs now
   say ICU-dependent; the substance of the claim — nothing time-zone-dependent is left under the
   code — holds.

3. **A slice-A bug the new fixture caught.** `jsrt_date_to_utc_string` padded a negative year to six
   digits (`Sat, 01 Jan -000001 00:00:00 GMT`) on the strength of a comment claiming Node does. Node
   pads to four: `Fri, 01 Jan -0001 00:00:00 GMT`. Six is `toISOString`'s expanded-year form only.
   No slice-A fixture had a negative year, so nothing contradicted the comment. `write_year` now
   pads to four for both human string forms and `toISOString` keeps formatting its own year;
   `tests/golden/ts/date_local.ts` carries a year -1 through both.

**The design decision worth recording: the local→instant inverse.** `LocalTime(t) = t + LocalTZA(t)`
is a function; `UTC(local)` is not its inverse, because across a DST transition a wall-clock reading
either names no instant (the spring-forward gap) or names two (the autumn fold). The first
implementation probed once — `offset_at(local)`, subtract, re-probe, retry if the offset moved — and
is correct everywhere except the fold, where it returns the LATER instant. Node returns the earlier:
2024-10-27T02:30 in Berlin is `2024-10-27T00:30:00.000Z` (CEST), not `01:30Z` (CET).

§21.4.1.26 is explicit about why: both the gap and the fold are resolved with the offset in effect
*before* the transition, which for the fold is `possibleInstants[0]`, the earlier one. The
implementation follows the spec's own shape — probe the offset one day either side (its `before` is
`t - 1 day`), build both candidates, take the first whose own offset validates it, and fall back to
the pre-transition candidate when neither validates, which is exactly the gap. One day is a wider
window than any real zone's offset (max ±14:00) and narrower than any pair of transitions.

**Evidence.** Cross-checked against the pinned Node (v26.7.0) in seven zones — `UTC`,
`Europe/Berlin`, `America/New_York`, `Australia/Lord_Howe`, `Asia/Kolkata`, `Pacific/Chatham`,
`America/Sao_Paulo` — over a probe covering both DST hemispheres, 30- and 45-minute offsets, a
no-DST control, pre-epoch instants, every month boundary, rollover in both directions and the
Invalid-Date recovery path. Byte-identical in all seven.

**Why `TZ=UTC` and not a zone that would exercise the difference.** A non-UTC pin would make the
golden fixtures actually distinguish local from UTC — but the compiled binary reads the tzdb through
libc and the Node ground truth reads it through ICU, and those two ship on independent schedules. A
tzdata skew between them would surface as a golden byte diff indistinguishable from a semantics bug.
Under UTC they cannot disagree. The cost is that goldens can only prove wiring and arithmetic, which
is why every zone-dependent claim moved to `tests/unit/date-local.test.ts` with an explicit `TZ` per
case, on dates whose rules have been fixed since 1996.

## 134. The §13 `typescript`-API tripwire, measured: not tripped — the cost at scale is ours (2026-09-01)

**Plan:** §13's first risk row arms a tripwire on the `typescript` API — *"checking >30% of compile
wall-time, or OOM on a 100k-line graph"* — whose response is program reuse and caching first, then
`oxc-parser` for parsing with the checker kept for types only, and a quarterly tsgo re-test recorded
here. §12 repeats it as a standing practice. This is that measurement, and it is the first one.

**Method.** A generated chain of `ts`-mode modules (N modules × 40 exported functions, each a typed
loop plus a branch; every function reachable from `main`, so DCE keeps the whole graph and clang
really compiles it). Each stage timed in-process around the same functions `src/cli/build.ts` calls,
then the whole `stator build` — node startup and clang included — timed around the CLI. Host: Apple
M3 Max, Darwin 25.6.0 arm64, Apple clang 21.0.0, Node v26.7.0, release runtime built against Boehm.
The harness stays out of the tree: it is a measurement, not a test.

| lines | createProgram | gate | lower | verify | emitC | front end | full build | `typescript` share |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 11,350 | 262 ms | 39 ms | 126 ms | 190 ms | 18 ms | 0.65 s | 3.1 s | **13.6%** |
| 44,700 | 538 ms | 137 ms | 690 ms | 3.6 s | 209 ms | 5.2 s | 14.9 s | **9.2%** |
| 111,750 | 1.18 s | 342 ms | 2.95 s | 21.5 s | 158 ms | 26.2 s | 52.3 s | **8.5%** |

The share is `createProgram` + gate + lowering's checker queries over the full build's wall time.
Peak RSS at 111,750 lines was 856 MB, on the default heap — no OOM, no `--max-old-space-size`.

**Result: not tripped, and moving away from the wire.** The `typescript` API's share *falls* as the
graph grows, because everything that grows faster is ours. `oxc-parser` and tsgo stay parked; next
re-test due 2026-12. Note what a smaller, more natural corpus would have said: at 11k lines the
share is 13.6%, and on a corpus where most code is dead it read 58% — the number is meaningless
without a graph the backend actually compiles, which is why the fixture keeps every function live.

**What the measurement did find, in order of size.**

1. **`verifyHir` is quadratic in program size.** `verifyFunction` and `verifyBlock` each copy the
   entire enclosing scope (`new Map(bindings)`, `src/hir/verify.ts:587` and `:569`), so a module of
   M hoisted functions pays O(M) per scope entered, and every function body enters several. Measured
   190 ms → 3.6 s → 21.5 s across the three sizes: n^2.1 then n^1.9. At 111,750 lines it is 82% of
   the front end and 41% of the entire build — five times the whole `typescript` API. A parent-linked
   scope (lookup walks the chain; `set` writes to the innermost) removes the copy without changing
   what the verifier accepts. **Not done here** — it is a pass rewrite with its own Check, not a
   side effect of a measurement.
2. **One translation unit is half the build.** clang takes ~26 s of the 52 s at 111,750 lines, on a
   44 MB `.c`. That is §12's "split emitted C per module and compile in parallel" standing practice,
   now with a number attached rather than an assumption.
3. **A crash, fixed in this change.** At 111,750 lines the emitter died before clang ever ran:
   `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` at `src/codegen/index.ts:432` —
   `out.push(...functionLines, ...mainLines)` spreads the whole program's emitted lines into the
   argument list, which overflows somewhere between 45k and 112k input lines. It reached the user as
   a raw V8 stack trace, since `main()` rethrows anything that is not a `StatorError`/`BuildError`.
   Both program-scale spreads (`:432`, and `:485` per function unit) are loops now. Golden suite
   93/93 after the change, so the emitted bytes are unchanged.

**plan.md edited:** yes — §13's row records this measurement and its date, and §12 gains the
verifier finding as a standing practice with its numbers, since nothing in the ladder covered it.

## 135. Task 0.1's Check could only pass on the commit that closed it (2026-09-01)

**Plan:** §3 Task 0.1's Check read "`NICHE.md` exists with the three required elements; `git
describe --tags --exact-match HEAD` succeeds on its commit with tag `phase-0-approved`."

**Contradiction.** That command asks whether HEAD *is* the approval commit. It was, for exactly one
commit — `f5bdb0c`, tagged `phase-0-approved` — and has been false at every HEAD since. Five commits
later:

```
$ git describe --tags --exact-match HEAD
fatal: no tag exactly matches 'e27e118bf3fd763995e900d5bd41c6e564ab788c'
$ git rev-list --count phase-0-approved..HEAD
5
```

So the gate that §15.1 makes every later phase point at reported itself un-passed, permanently,
while the fact it was meant to establish — an owner-approved `NICHE.md` under a tag — had not
changed at all. Under golden rule 1 ("a task is done only when its Check passes") that is not a
cosmetic defect: re-running the Check is how a reader confirms Phase 0 without taking `done.md`'s
word for it, and `done.md` is explicitly not an authority.

**Fix.** The Check now asserts the durable fact instead of the position of HEAD:

```
$ git cat-file -e phase-0-approved:NICHE.md            # exit 0 — tag resolves AND carries the file
$ git log --diff-filter=A --format=%H phase-0-approved -- NICHE.md
f5bdb0c6da59ac746cfddf925a09bccae6adfe24              # == git rev-parse phase-0-approved^{commit}
```

One command proves what the gate is for (a tag named `phase-0-approved` whose commit carries the
approved `NICHE.md`); the second, kept as the stronger form, proves that commit is the one that
*added* the file rather than one that happened to inherit it. Neither mentions HEAD, so both answer
the same at any future HEAD, on any clone that has the tag.

**The general rule, added to §15 rule 2.** A Check must stay re-runnable at any later HEAD. An
assertion *about* HEAD — `--exact-match HEAD`, "the working tree is clean", a line number — is a
point-in-time observation, not a Check, and it converts finished work into work that reports itself
unfinished. Task 0.1 was the only Check in `plan.md` written that way (`grep -n HEAD plan.md done.md`
finds one other hit, §7 Task 4.7 step 1's "recount at execution HEAD", which is an instruction to
the executing agent, not an assertion).

**What was NOT changed.** The approval itself, `NICHE.md`, and the tag: the gate is closed and stays
closed, and nothing here re-decides it — that would need §15.4's bar and a human, per AGENTS.md.
The five gate steps stay in `plan.md` §3 for the reason both files already give: they are the gate's
definition, and §15.1 enforces itself by pointing at them.

**plan.md edited:** yes — §3's Check replaced (with the discarded form and why, kept as a warning),
and §15 rule 2 extended. `done.md`'s Phase 0 record now cites the re-verified output.

---

## 136. Task 4.7's inventory was 2.6× short, and 70 of the sites name a phase that closed on 2026-08-30 (2026-09-01)

**Plan:** §7 Task 4.7 says **63 call sites in `src/frontend/gate.ts` name phase 4** (audited at
`39cf053`, plan-notes 127), and its step 1 says to re-derive the inventory at execution HEAD rather
than assume it. This is that re-derivation, and it did not just move the number.

**Method.** The earlier counts were greps, which is why note 130 already had to defend the 63
against challengers whose single-line patterns missed multi-line `notYet(` calls. This one parses:
a `ts.createSourceFile` walk over `gate.ts` collecting every `CallExpression` whose callee is
`notYet` or `dateNotYet`, reporting each site's line, its second argument verbatim, and its
enclosing function. Same tool the compiler itself uses, so a multi-line call, a template-literal
message and a nested ternary all count exactly once.

**Result at `89de482`** — 165 sites, not 63:

| phase named | sites | what they are |
|---|---|---|
| **3** | **70** | the lowering ladder's residue — `ts`-mode static language surface |
| 4 | 63 | the audited group (builtin arity/spread/member catch-alls, module surface) |
| `dateNotYet` → 4 | 10 | the `Date` residue, hardcoded inside the helper |
| 5 | 18 | already re-homed by earlier slices |
| 8 | 2 | `with`, `eval` |
| 7 | 1 | `importing a package` |
| 6 | 1 | `destructuring in a for-of binding` |

**The finding is the first row.** Phase 3 is **COMPLETE (2026-08-30)** — `done.md` line 108, and
`plan.md` §6's heading. Seventy diagnostics name it as their deliverer. This is not a latent
mislabel; it is user-visible today:

```
$ node src/cli/main.ts build /tmp/rest.ts -o /tmp/rest
/tmp/rest.ts:1:12 STA1214 [ts] rest parameters are not yet supported; planned for Phase 3
```

`notYet(message, phase)` renders `${message}; planned for Phase ${phase}`, so every one of the 70 is
a shipped promise pointing at finished work. Exactly the defect Task 4.7 exists to end — and the
task would have closed without touching a single one of them.

**Root cause, and it is the same shape as note 116's.** Task 4.7 was written while Phase 4 was
closing, so it asked *"which sites name phase 4?"* — a question about the phase that happened to be
open. The rule the task itself establishes ("a not-yet names the phase that owns its **blocker**,
never the phase that happens to be open") implies the general question: *does any site name a phase
already complete?* Nobody asked it, because the audit inherited the framing of the moment. Phase 3
closed on 2026-08-30 and no sweep ran; Phases 1 and 2 closed earlier and, by luck, left no
pointers behind (a `notYet(…, 2)` search finds none — the walking-skeleton deferrals were rewritten
to 3 and 4 as the ladder advanced, which is the same sweep, done informally, that nobody repeated
for 3).

**How the 70 got there.** The ladder's rungs each landed a core and deferred its surface under
`notYet(…, 3)` *while Phase 3 was open* — rung 4 landed calls and deferred rest/default/optional/
destructuring parameters, rung 6 landed class layout and deferred accessors, statics, computed
names, `#private` collisions, overloads and override rules, and so on. Each was honest when
written. Phase 3's Check passed on the eight rungs it named, not on the surface they deferred, and
the residue outlived its owner.

**No phase owns them.** §1.1 promises *"Everything else that is typed TS should eventually compile
… Gaps on the way are 'not yet' diagnostics naming the phase that delivers them."* Phase 5 is `js`
mode plus the surface **Phase 4** deferred; 6 is conformance, 7 FFI, 8 the dynamic tier. The
`ts`-mode static surface Phase 3 deferred — rest parameters, destructuring, the class member
surface, generics beyond monomorphization, object-literal forms, bound method values — is
unscheduled, in the mode that is the product's default.

**plan.md edited:** yes, in this change.
- §7 Task 4.7: the inventory paragraph now carries the parsed 165 and its distribution, step 1
  gains the general question (*any* completed phase, not phase 4), and a new group is added to
  step 6 for the ladder residue.
- §8 Phase 5: **step 12** added — "the lowering ladder's residue" — owning the static-TS surface,
  grouped by construct family, with its own Check. This follows Task 4.7 step 6's own instruction
  ("EDIT §8/§11 in the same change to give it one"); it is deliberately NOT a new phase, because
  §15.3 forbids renumbering (`plan.md §N Task X.Y` is cited from code comments and `docs/`).
  Phase 5's preamble already warns that steps 8–11 becoming a bucket is the signal to split; step
  12 makes that warning live, so the preamble now names the split trigger explicitly instead of
  leaving it to feel.

**Also observed, not fixed here:** `plan-notes.md` has a **third** numbering collision — two
entries numbered `133` (lines 3273 and 3323, both 2026-09-01). Note 115 set the handling: renumber
the newer entry, never retroactively renumber a note others may cite. Both 133s predate this entry
and both are already cited, so neither is safe to move by the rule that produced the rule; recorded
here so the next collision is the fourth, not a surprise.

## 138. LLVM clang is a mise pin, not a system package (2026-09-01)

**Context.** `mise.toml` already pinned Node and pnpm. clang was "whatever Xcode CLT / apt
shipped", which is what `docs/TOOLCHAIN.md` recorded as an unversioned `C compiler` row.

**Decision.** Pin LLVM **21.1.8** in `mise.toml` as `conda:llvm` + `conda:clang`, Unix-only.
Conda is the prebuilt backend: the asdf `mise-llvm` plugin downloads the llvm-project tarball
and compiles it with ninja, which is not a toolchain pin. Windows is out because the runtime
Makefile is not a Windows toolchain (plan-notes 122) and those backends are bash/conda, not a
MSVC story. `make`/`ar`/`pkg-config`/`diff` stay system packages; they are not the compiler.

`STA0008` now names `mise install` first. CI still uses the runner's clang (plus `apt install
clang llvm` on Linux next to libgc-dev) — a version pin on GitHub-hosted images is a different
change from making `mise install` the local bootstrap.

**plan.md edited:** no. The C11/clang requirement did not change.

## 139. Architecture diagrams switch from Mermaid to D2 (2026-09-01)

**Request.** Owner asked for D2 as the modern diagram of how the compiler works, and for
`AGENTS.md` to tell agents about it.

**What landed.** `docs/architecture/*.d2` is the source (pipeline, build sequence, packages,
value-flow — the same four views plan-notes 126 put in Mermaid). SVGs next to them are the
GitHub-visible render (`d2` v0.8.2). `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` is the gallery. Mermaid is gone
from that file: GitHub does not render D2 natively, so the committed SVG is the display path.
`d2` is a docs tool (`brew install d2`), not a compile pin and not in CI.

`plan.md` §2 now names D2 instead of Mermaid; repo layout lists `architecture/*.d2`.
`AGENTS.md` gained an "Architecture diagrams (for agents)" section so agents read the `.d2`
files rather than inventing a fifth view.

Same subordination as 126: diagrams visualize §2, they never override it.

## 140. The `inferred` provenance grade was already landed, and the plan asked for it in the wrong words (2026-09-01)

**Context.** Phase 5 step 1's only remaining item, per its own text: *"the `inferred` middle grade
— today lowering grades only typed-vs-dynamic; a `.js` function whose signature the checker
recovered (JSDoc or inference) must report `inferred`."*

**Finding 1: it was landed before the sentence was written.** `provenanceOf`
(`src/lower/index.ts`) has returned all three grades since `5e9f2b4` (2026-08-31); the step-1
detail that calls it remaining was written on 2026-09-01 (plan-notes 131, v2.7), a day later.
Live, at this HEAD:

```
$ node src/cli/main.ts explain grades.ts --json
{"verdict":"static","functions":[
  {"name":"whole","line":1,"provenance":"typed","verdict":"static"},
  {"name":"halfWritten","line":2,"provenance":"inferred","verdict":"static"}]}
$ node src/cli/main.ts explain grades.js --mode=js --json
{"verdict":"dynamic","functions":[
  {"name":"whole","line":5,"provenance":"typed","verdict":"static"},
  {"name":"halfWritten","line":7,"provenance":"inferred","verdict":"static"},
  {"name":"none","line":8,"provenance":"dynamic","verdict":"dynamic"}]}
```

Plan-notes 131's method — write the steps against the live tree — is the right one; it read
`explain`'s printer and `program.ts`, saw the substrate, and did not read `provenanceOf`. The
lesson is 136's again at a smaller scale: a step that says "already landed: A, B, C — remaining:
D" has to check D against the tree with the same care it checked A, B and C.

**Finding 2: the plan and the tree disagree on what `inferred` MEANS, and they are inverted.**
Step 1 and step 6 both grade a JSDoc-annotated `.js` function `inferred`; the tree grades it
`typed`, on the ground that `@param {number} x` is the same claim by the same author as
`x: number`. Worse, the two readings put the trust axis in opposite directions: step 5 says
"`typed` callers trust, `inferred`/`dynamic` sources get checks", while the landed test comment
says "an annotation is a claim a boundary must check, an inference is derived from the code and is
already sound". One field, two contradictory meanings, and step 5 was about to be keyed on it.

**Finding 3, the measurement that settles it.** Step 5's premise — a lying JSDoc produces a
located RUNTIME type error — does not hold. `program.ts` sets `checkJs: mode === 'js'` and
surfaces every `ts.getPreEmitDiagnostics` entry as a fatal `STA0012`, so the lie never reaches a
runtime check:

```
$ cat math.js
/** @param {number} x @returns {number} */
export function double(x) { return x * 2; }
$ cat main.ts
import { double } from "./math.js";
const result: number = double("5");
$ node src/cli/main.ts build main.ts -o app --mode=js
main.ts:2:31 STA0012 [js] Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
```

A JSDoc that contradicts its own body fails the same way. So a JSDoc is not an unverified claim in
this compiler — `checkJs` verifies it, and the gate makes the verdict fatal. What DOES survive to
runtime is a dynamic argument reaching an annotated signature (a value from `JSON.parse`, from an
un-annotated `.js` export, later from FFI). That is a property of the EDGE, and no per-function
grade can express it.

**Decision: keep the tree's semantics.** `typed` = the author annotated the signature whole, in
either spelling; `inferred` = the checker finished it; `dynamic` = an `Unknown` is in it, which
outranks both. Three reasons: it answers the question the field's name asks; it is strictly more
informative, since the `.ts`/`.js` split the plan wanted is already in the report's own file path;
and collapsing JSDoc to `inferred` would erase the annotated/un-annotated split INSIDE `.js`,
which is the only split js mode trades on. Note that within `.ts` the `typed`/`inferred` line
carries no trust difference at all — `strict` verifies both — which is the clearest sign that
provenance was never the right key for boundary insertion.

**plan.md edited** (same change, §15 rule 6):

- §8 step 1: struck through and marked landed, with the commit and the test; the JSDoc clause
  corrected, and the reason it was wrong recorded in the step itself so the next reader does not
  re-derive it.
- §8 step 5: the provenance key removed and replaced by the measurement above, with the edge named
  as the actual key. Its proof shape is corrected too: the trap fixture cannot be a lying JSDoc,
  because that program no longer reaches runtime.
- §8 step 6: provenance `inferred` → `typed`; the per-function half is landed, the file-level claim
  and its golden are what remain.

**Also fixed, in the same change:**

- `docs/MODES.md` §4 Example 1 asserted that `double("5")` against a `@param {number}` "type-checks
  (JSDoc says number)" and is caught by an emitted runtime check. It does not type-check, and no
  future work makes it — `tsc` reads the JSDoc, so the call is statically wrong. The example is
  rewritten to a lie `tsc` cannot see, which is what a boundary check is actually for.
- `docs/HIR.md`'s `FunctionExpr` bullet gained `provenance`. `provenanceOf`'s doc comment has cited
  `docs/HIR.md` since `5e9f2b4` and the field was never described there.

**Not fixed here:** `MODES.md` §4's other two examples describe boundary checks that are step 5's
to make true; they are not wrong in the way Example 1 was, so they stay as written.

## 141. Three mode-table codes were allocated and dead, for three different reasons (2026-09-02)

**Context.** Phase 5 step 2: switch the diagnostic table by mode. (a) `any`/`as any` in js mode
stops being `STA1001`; (b) `var` legal in js only; (c) a `.js` entry under ts is `STA1002` with
"use `--mode=js`"; (d) `eval`/`new Function` in js emit **`STA1206`**, which DIAGNOSTICS.md had
allocated and src/ emitted nowhere.

**Finding 1: `STA1002` could not fire.** `src/frontend/program.ts` set `allowJs: mode === 'js'`.
Under ts mode, tsc **drops** a `.js` root file; `getSourceFiles()` never contains it, so the
gate's `fileName.endsWith('.js')` arm is unreachable. `build` reports `programDiagnostics`
before the gate, so the user saw `STA0012` "enable the 'allowJs' option" — the wrong code and
the wrong flag. `allowJs` is now on in both modes; `checkJs` stays js-only. The gate is what
refuses the file.

**Finding 2: the eval check was dead for the opposite reason.** It fired only when
`getSymbolAtLocation(eval) === undefined`. `eval` has a lib.es5 declaration, so the check
accepted and `gateIdentifier`'s global catch-all reported `STA1214` "the global 'eval'",
Phase 5. Same for `new Function` ("new on this type") and `Function(...)`. Dedicated codes
`STA1101`/`STA1103`/`STA1206` existed and were unreachable. The identifier is now recognized
the way `Date` is (declaration-file test), including `globalThis.eval` and aliasing
(`const e = eval`).

**Finding 3: `as any` was classified as implicit.** `const x = 1 as any` has no annotation on
the BINDING, so `isImplicitAny` fired `STA1003` first; the AsExpression child also fired
`STA1001`; `classify` picks the first never. The author wrote `any`. `isImplicitAny` now skips
an initializer that is `as any` / `<any>x`.

**(b) was already true.** `var` is `STA1104` never in ts and `STA1214` not-yet in js. Step 2
asked only that the split exist; the lowering is step 3, and `subset_var_declarations_js.js`
stays expected-fail at `@verdict: static`.

**Out of scope, recorded so it is not "fixed" by accident.** Indirect eval `(0, eval)("x")`
is still "calling an arbitrary expression" (`STA1214`). A comma-expression callee is not the
identifier `eval`, and teaching the gate to see through it is a different check than the
mode table.

**plan.md edited:** yes, §8 step 2 struck through; Phase 8 item 5 no longer claims `STA1206`
has never been emitted.


## 142. `var` desugars to a hoisted `let`; checkJs still rejects the classic use-before-decl spelling (2026-09-02)

Phase 5 step 3. js mode now accepts `var`. The HIR did not grow a third `declKind`.

**Desugaring.** Each `var` name is collected from the function (or module), skipping nested
functions. Names not already bound (a parameter or a function declaration) become a `let`
initialized `undefined` at the top of that unit. The original site is an assignment if it has
an initializer, and a no-op otherwise. A second `var` of the same name is a second write to
the same slot — that is the spec's Instantiation, not a second Declaration node.

**Why no `declKind: 'var'`.** The runtime difference from `let` is *where the slot lives and
when it is initialized*, not how it is stored. Putting that in the lowering keeps every pass
that already understands `let`/`assignment` honest, and stops a later pass inventing a second
TDZ.

**Loop capture.** `gateIdentifier` used to refuse any capture whose declaration AST sat inside
a loop. For `var` that is the wrong scope: the binding is function-scoped, so capturing it is
the ordinary shared-binding case env capture already implements. The refusal now applies only
to `let`/`const` (per-iteration bindings, still Phase 5 step 12 / the capture-in-loop row).

**checkJs vs the classic spelling.** `console.log(x); var x = 1` is legal JS and the lowering
desugars it (pinned by `tests/unit/var.test.ts`, which does not run the tsc diagnostic
surface). `program.ts` still forwards every checkJs diagnostic as `STA0012`, and checkJs under
`strict` reports "Variable 'x' is used before being assigned" for that spelling. Dropping that
one tsc code would be a policy change this step does not own. The golden therefore proves the
runtime fact with the equivalent form checkJs accepts: `var x; console.log(x); x = 1`. Same
slot, same `undefined`, no TDZ.

**Parameter shadow.** `function f(x) { var x = 2 }` is one slot. checkJs also rejects
`var x = 2` against an untyped parameter (`any` vs `number`); the golden uses `var x; x = 2`
so the subsequent declaration has no initializer type to disagree with.

**Biome.** `docs/architecture/` (generated D2 SVGs) is excluded from `biome.json`. The a11y
`noSvgWithoutTitle` rule fires on every generated rectangle; those files are diagrams, not UI.

**plan.md edited:** yes, §8 step 3 struck through.


## 143. Empty `{}` is dynamic; STA2004 shrinks to grow-only; STA4058 retires (2026-09-02)

Phase 5 step 4. The runtime half (shape table + ICs) existed; the lowering did not target
Unknown receivers, and the shape-table entry points panicked on anything that was not a
`JSRTDynObject`.

**Empty `{}`.** `isDynamicShape` now includes zero-property anonymous types, and
`shapeTypeToHType` returns null for them, so they are Unknown in HIR rather than a layout
with no slots. An all-required anonymous shape *with at least one field* stays fixed —
making those dynamic would deoptimize every literal. Growing therefore works for
`let o = {}; o.x = 1` and not for `let o = { x: 1 }; o.y = 2` (STA2004).

**STA2004.** The aliased-read honesty clause is lifted: `jsrt_get_prop` walks the class
descriptor for a fixed object, so `const a = { x: 1 }; const b: { x?: number } = a; b.x`
prints `1`. Growing a key the descriptor does not list still cannot invent a slot, and
that is the remaining STA2004 (Phase 8, dictionary mode).

**STA4058 retired.** Nullish → TypeError; string `"length"` → length; other primitives →
`undefined` on get / TypeError on set; arrays share the property table they already had
for match-array fields.

**Call convention.** `jsrt_call_at` names `file:line` (`STA2006`). Column is not on `Span`
(the BoundaryCheck `where` rationale). `this` is not argv[0] for ordinary functions: the
gate still forbids `this` outside class members, so prepending the receiver would break
every non-method. Arity padding was already `jsrt_arg`.

**js-only 2339/2551/2353.** checkJs reports "property does not exist" for untyped `o.x = 1`.
Those three codes are skipped in js mode only, so the shape table can answer at run time.
ts mode still surfaces them as `STA0012`.

**`==`.** Already `jsrt_loose_equals` with ToPrimitive (NUMERIC.md §6.3.1);
`tests/golden/js/to-primitive.js` pins the table. Not re-derived here.

**plan.md edited:** yes, §8 step 4 struck through.

**JSON.parse `data.x`.** `subset_json_parse_boundary_js.js` flipped: the parse result is
Unknown, so `data.x` is now a shape-table read rather than a not-yet. The ts counterpart
stays expected-fail (`any` return is STA1001).

**Empty `{}` as an argument.** Contextual type `any` is not a shape, so the gate used to
refuse `f({})` as "shape is not a layout" after empty objects stopped being a zero-field
layout. `objectLiteralIsDynamic` falls back to the literal's own type.

**Computed-index ICs.** An inline cache is "same shape implies same offset" for a key *fixed at
the site* (`o.x`). `o[k]` reuses one site for many keys, so a shape-only hit would return the
wrong slot (the golden's `get(o, 'missing')` answered `1` after `get(o, 'x')`). Dyn-index
passes `NULL` for the cache.

**Match arrays.** `m.length` is a match-read, and match receivers are Unknown, so the new
dyn-field arm stole it and `jsrt_get_prop` walked the property table, missing `length`. The
match-read arm is restored (skip match receivers in dyn-field), and `jsrt_get_prop` answers
array `"length"` for Unknown array receivers.

## 145. Code coverage uses Node's test runner, not c8 (2026-09-02)

`pnpm run test:coverage` is `--experimental-test-coverage` scoped to `src/**`, with
`--test-coverage-include-all` so a file the suite never loads counts as 0% rather than
vanishing from the report. The lcov output is `coverage/lcov.info`. No new dependency —
the budget is still `typescript` only; Node 26 already prints the table and emits lcov.

CI: the linux/x64 frontend job is the one that builds the runtime and therefore exercises
the native-only unit tests, so it owns the report. Other frontend platforms keep
`pnpm run test`. `pnpm run ci` uses the coverage run in place of the plain one.

C runtime coverage (llvm-cov) is a different toolchain and is not this change. Thresholds
are not gated: the first measured numbers (unit tests over `src/`) were about 91% lines /
87% branches / 95% functions, and a floor is a later policy call.

**plan.md edited:** no.

## 144. Mixed-graph checks wrap the edge; a typed-looking lie is a compile error (2026-09-02)

Phase 5 step 5. Three things the plan's proof-shape paragraph got slightly wrong, measured rather
than re-litigated:

1. **The trap cannot be a function whose body checkJs can type.** `export function factorFrom(n) {
   return String(n); }` assigned to `const factor: number` is `STA0012` "Type 'string' is not
   assignable to type 'number'" — the same compile-error path plan-notes 140 already recorded for a
   lying JSDoc. The value that reaches runtime is an *untyped* identity, `function wrap(x) { return
   x; }`, whose return is `any` and therefore Unknown. `wrap("10")` into a `number` slot is the
   trap; `wrap(10)` into the same slot is the happy path.

2. **Expected-stderr on the golden harness was not added.** STA2004 and STA2006 already pin runtime
   aborts as CLI native tests (`NATIVE_ONLY`, empty stdout, code in stderr). A second harness mode
   whose only client would be this one trap is duplication. The happy-path mixed graph is an
   ordinary vs-Node golden; the trap is `tests/unit/cli.test.ts`.

3. **`docs/MODES.md` §4 Examples 2 and 3 were false.** Example 2 assigned an inferred `number`
   (`MAX_RETRIES = 3`) to `string` and called that a runtime check; it is `STA0012`. Example 3
   assigned `unknown[]` to `number[]` and promised per-element checks; `number[]` is not
   `isCheckable`, so the assignment is not wrapped and element reads stay dynamic until a checkable
   narrowing at the use. Both examples rewritten.

The wrap itself is `maybeBoundary` in `src/lower/index.ts`: Unknown value + checkable expected type
→ `BoundaryCheck`. Call arguments use the callee's HIR `fn` parameter types, so builtins that lower
to their own nodes (`Math.abs`, `JSON.parse`) are not wrapped by this path — they already have a
typed lowering of their own.

## 146. js-column expected-fail was stale for landed operators; `var xs = []` was STA4004 (2026-09-02)

Phase 5 step 7. Note 145 is the coverage runner from a parallel change the same day; this is the
step 7 record.

The plan's "64 fixture files" was already stale (32 js files after steps 2–4). Of those, twelve
were constructs that compiled today and had never had their marker removed:

- Typed *literals* (`5 + 3`, `5 & 3`, `` `Hello ${name}` ``, `switch (2)`, `const x = 42`) are
  **static**, not the `dynamic` the fixtures claimed. The js column is dynamic for *untyped
  operands*; these fixtures never had any.
- `function test(x) { if (x > 0) ... }` is **dynamic** because `x` is untyped — the fixture said
  `static`.
- `null ?? 0` is STA0012 (checkJs rejects a literal `??`); `function coalesce(x) { return x ?? 0; }`
  is the js-column case and is dynamic.

The rest stay expected-fail because the construct is not landed (`**`, rest, destructure, `for-in`,
`import()`, generators, …) or the allocated never-code is not the one emitted (`@dec` is STA1214
not STA1112). Those flip in their owner step, not here.

`var xs = []` (and `var hits = search()` returning an array) was an internal STA4004:
`hTypeAssignable` treated `unknown[]` as an array, so the Unknown-on-either-side clause did not
fire, and `hTypeEquals` then rejected two `unknown[]` that differed only in `fromImplicitAny` —
exactly the split the `var` hoist introduces. Recursing into array elements is the same rule the
Unknown clause already stated.

The capstone is `tests/golden/js/capstone.js`, an untyped catalog: growing empty objects, computed
index, Unknown call, `==`, `var` on scalars.

## 147. `for-of` over a string is a counted loop of code points, not units (2026-09-02)

Phase 5 step 8, first code slice after the §4.13 representation. `String.prototype[@@iterator]`
yields code points: `"a👍b"` is three iterations, and the middle value has `.length === 2`. The
loop calls `jsrt_string_iter_next`, which advances the UTF-16 cursor by 1 or 2. Map/Set/user
iterables, `keys`/`values`/`entries`, `matchAll`, and `function*` are still open under this step.

The gate test that used `for (const c of 'ab')` as the non-array STA1214 witness now uses a `Map`.

## 148. `for-of` over Map and Set is a live insertion-order walk (2026-09-02)

Phase 5 step 8, after string for-of. No protocol object: the emitter writes `jsrt_map_iter_begin` /
`jsrt_map_iter_next` / `jsrt_map_iter_end` (Set shares the table and has `jsrt_set_iter_next`).
The walk re-reads `used` so a body that `set`/`add`s is visited, and skips `!live` so a deletion
of a not-yet-reached entry is not. `iterating` is the same compaction-suppression counter
`forEach` uses; a throw or return from the body runs `iter_end` through a codegen finally so
the count cannot leak.

A Map yields a two-element array. The HIR has no tuple, so the binding is Unknown and a ts-mode
file that uses the pair is dynamic even when K and V are typed. A Set yields the element type,
so a typed Set for-of stays static.

Remaining under this step: the nine `keys`/`values`/`entries` members, `matchAll`, `function*`,
and `for-of` over a user iterable.

## 149. Runtime build is a justfile, not a Makefile (2026-09-02)

`runtime/Makefile` is gone. The recipes live in a repo-root `justfile`: `just runtime`,
`just runtime-asan`, `just runtime-intl`, `just runtime-test`, `just runtime-test-asan`,
`just runtime-clean`. Incrementality is a timestamp walk of each `.c` and the `-MMD` sidecar
the compiler writes, so a header change still rebuilds (plan-notes 66). `CC` from the
environment still wins; unset, it is clang.

`just` is pinned at 1.58.0 in `mise.toml`. CI installs it via `extractions/setup-just@v3`
on every job that builds the archive (frontend Unix, runtime, asan, intl). Windows frontend
never builds the runtime.

Live diagnostics (STA0011, STA1210, STA1215) and live comments name the recipes. Historical
`plan-notes.md` / `done.md` evidence of `make -C runtime` stays as written.

## 150. Array/Map/Set `keys`/`values`/`entries` (2026-09-02)

Phase 5 step 8. When the call is the operand of a `for-of`, the emitter inlines the specialized
walk (`view` on the for-of node) and allocates nothing. When the call is stored
(`const it = arr.keys()`), the runtime boxes a `JSRTIterator` — a cursor plus a kind tag, not a
`next` closure — and `it.next()` is `jsrt_iterator_next`, answering `{ value, done }` as a nameless
dynamic object. for-of over a stored iterator is `jsrt_iterator_step`.

Map `for-of` / `entries()` still yield a two-element array, so a ts-mode file that uses the pair
is dynamic (no tuple). Array `keys()` yields numbers and stays static; Set `keys()`/`values()`
yield the element.

User iterables and `matchAll` / `function*` remain open under this step.

## 151. `String.prototype.matchAll` (2026-09-02)

Phase 5 step 8. `matchAll` is a boxed specialized iterator (`JSRT_ITER_MATCH_ALL`): the
runtime clones the `/g` regexp so walking cannot mutate the original `lastIndex`, each
`next()`/`for-of` step is `RegExpBuiltinExec` yielding a match array, and an empty match
still AdvanceStringIndex so the walk cannot spin. A non-global pattern is STA2005 (the
spec's TypeError); a non-regexp argument stays `STA1214` (RegExpCreate).

Remaining under this step: `function*`, and `for-of` over a user iterable.

## 152. `function*` / `yield` (2026-09-02)

Phase 5 step 8. A generator is a `JSRTGenerator`, not a tagged `JSRTIterator`: the cursor is a
resume point and the locals live in a heap environment. `gen()` only allocates; the body runs
on the first `next()`. `yield e` parks `e` and pops the C frame; a later `next(v)` is the
value of that yield. `for-of` uses `jsrt_iterator_step` and discards the completion value.
Uncaught throws stay pending for the call site of `next()`; the object is marked done so a
later `next()` does not re-enter.

`next(v)` lands. Generator methods, async generators, and `for await` stay **STA1201**.
`yield*` is STA1214. `.return()` / `.throw()` on the generator object stay not-yet.

Remaining under this step: `for-of` over a user iterable (needs `Symbol` as a value).

## 153. Generator `.return()` / `.throw()`, and the suspension-state fix they exposed (2026-09-02)

Phase 5 step 8. The closing pair lands as an INJECTION, not a value: `jsrt_generator_close` /
`jsrt_generator_throw` set `inject` on the `JSRTGenerator` and resume the parked label, where the
generated prologue reads and clears the mode. THROW rethrows at the yield's own landing pad (the
body's `try`/`catch` cannot tell it from a `yield` that threw); RETURN parks the value in the
return slot and runs the ordinary return routing, so every enclosing `finally` runs and a finally
that yields suspends again with the completion value already parked. Unstarted and completed
generators share GeneratorResumeAbrupt's (ECMA-262 27.5.1.3) one answer without entering the
body: `return(v)` answers `{ value: v, done: true }` — the NEW value, which the in-flight draft
got wrong on the completed branch — and `throw(e)` rethrows to the caller.

The gate admits the two only on a receiver the checker types as the declaration-file `Generator`
(`isGeneratorReceiver`): a boxed specialized iterator's `IterableIterator` type SPELLS the names
the object does not carry, and Node answers a TypeError there the runtime cannot raise yet —
that case stays not-yet (`Iterator.return on a specialized iterator`, Phase 5). The lowering's
defensive branch and the runtime's class guard share the new internal **STA4071**.

The finally-yield golden exposed a pre-existing hole: NO compiler-introduced C local survives a
suspension, because the resume `goto` jumps over its initializer and the frame it sat in was
popped. `yield` inside a `for (const x of arr)` looped forever on main; `return` through a
finally that itself awaits/yields read an indeterminate completion code. Two fixes, one rule
(the invariant the await emitter already stated: every local lives in the environment):

- The try/finally completion code is now a counted SLOT, boxed with `jsrt_number` — sync units
  get a `JSRT_LOCAL`, suspendable units an env slot, one code path for both. The exception stash
  was already a slot for the same reason; counting now claims the pair adjacently.
- A suspendable unit boxes EVERY specialized for-of (array, string, Map, Set) into a heap
  `JSRTIterator` — the same object a stored `arr.values()` drives — so the cursor survives.
  Strings gained `JSRT_ITER_STRING` (10) for this; the `JSRT_ITER_*` numbering is now named once
  in `ITER_KINDS` (src/codegen/index.ts) instead of twice as arithmetic. Sync units keep the
  zero-alloc inlined loops and the raw-int map cleanup completion.

Goldens: `tests/golden/{ts,js}/generator_close.*` (the eight-case edge matrix, byte-for-byte vs
Node), `tests/golden/ts/generator_loops.ts` (yield inside every specialized for-of, break/return
routing), and a `finAwait` case in `tests/golden/ts/async_await.ts`. Decision fixtures
`tests/subset/subset_generator_close_{ts,js}` pin the verdicts — dynamic in both modes, because
IteratorResult is an interface the HIR does not layout, which is also why no static fixture
calls `.next()`.

Remaining under step 8: `for-of` over a user iterable (needs `Symbol` as a value, STA1212).

## 154. User-iterable `for-of` is a compile-time method, not a Symbol primitive (2026-09-02)

Phase 5 step 8's remaining line said user-iterable `for-of` "needs `Symbol` as a value". Tags in
`docs/VALUE.md` §1 are fully allocated; Map/Date/Generator are Object-tagged plus a class pointer,
so a new Symbol NaN-box tag was never the path.

What landed: a class instance method `[Symbol.iterator]()` whose return type is already HIR
`iterator` (a Generator, or a boxed specialized iterator). Lowering wraps the `for-of` iterable
in a MethodCall of that method; the existing boxed-iterator walk drives the result. `Symbol.iterator`
as a *stored value*, `Symbol("id")`, and `Symbol.for` stay `STA1212`. Generator methods
(`*[Symbol.iterator]()`, `*m()`), async generators, and `for await` stay `STA1201`. `yield*`
and a custom `{next()}` object (not a Generator) stay `STA1214`.

TypeScript unique-ifies well-known symbol properties as `__@iterator@<id>` (the suffix is
per-program; do not hardcode it). `userIteratorMethod` looked up `__@iterator` and missed, so
the gate still emitted STA1214 for a class the checker could see. `hirPropertyName` canonicalizes
that spelling in `classTypeToHType` so the MethodCall slot, the vtable row, and the lookup agree.

Check: `tests/golden/ts/user_iterable.ts` and `tests/golden/js/user_iterable.js` match Node;
decision tests `subset_user_iterable_{ts,js}`; `subset_symbol_primitive_{ts,js}` dropped
`@expected-fail` and keep `STA1212`; unit test admits the class method and still rejects
`Symbol("id")` and `Iterable<number>`.

## 155. Top-level await is an async module unit; init stays topological (2026-09-02)

Phase 5 step 9 required an ordering decision before code. Node's ESM loader interleaves sibling
subgraphs: two modules that do not import each other both run their prefix, hit `await`, and
continue in registration order. Measured:

- `a` has TLA, sibling `b` does not: Node prints `a-start, b, a-end, main`
- both siblings have TLA: Node prints `sa-start, sb-start, sa-end, sb-end, siblings-main`

Stator merges the program into one module in Task 3.11's topological order and evaluates that body
as a single unit. There are no per-file init functions to schedule. Mirroring Node would invent a
scheduler the whole-program model does not have. Decision: **topological, not Node's interleaving**.
The difference is observable only among siblings; a linear import chain matches Node. Recorded in
`docs/MODES.md`.

Implementation: a top-level `await` marks `Module.isAsync`. The emitter keeps named bindings in
the globals array and puts temps/await-state in a heap environment so a suspension cannot drop
them. `main` roots the init promise, subscribes a completion that turns a rejection into
`jsrt_uncaught`, and drains the microtask queue. `STA1208` is no longer emitted (the code stays
allocated). Await in a non-async function remains `STA1214`.

Check: `tests/golden/{ts,js}/top_level_await.ts` match Node (`before / 42 / after`); decision
tests `subset_top_level_await_{ts,js}` are `static`; gate unit test admits top-level await and
still refuses `await` in a non-async function.

## 156. Literal `import()` is a namespace object plus `Promise.resolve` (2026-09-02)

Phase 5 step 10. A module namespace is not a new NaN-box tag: it is an `HObject` with
`namespace: true` whose fields ARE the target file's export list. Field reads compile to the
export's global slot, so `ns.x` and the binding are the same cell. The object value is a dummy
literal of those identifiers, enough for `import()` to put something in a Promise; identity,
printing, and `Object.keys` are not the spec's Module exotic object.

Literal `import("./m.ts")` is accepted by the gate, recorded as a value-import edge (so `m`'s
top-level has already run in Task 3.11 order), and lowers to `Promise.resolve` of that dummy.
`typeof import("m")` maps through `moduleNamespaceToHType` so `m.n` is a FieldAccess, not a
dynamic get. A computed specifier stays `STA1207` (Phase 8). `STA1207` remains allocated.

TypeScript puts Module bits on a fresh `let o = {}` binding (ValueModule|NamespaceModule plus BlockScopedVariable). `moduleNamespaceToHType` therefore also requires that the symbol is not a Variable and that its declaration is a SourceFile or module declaration; without that, `{ x: number }` was marked `namespace: true` and `o.x = 1` was STA1214.

A live-binding golden that mutates an export through `m.setK(2)` needs calling an exported
function as a namespace method; this landing proves `m.n` and the init-edge, not that call shape.

Check: `tests/golden/{ts,js}/dynamic_import/main.ts` match Node (`42`); decision tests
`subset_dynamic_import_{ts,js}` are `static`; `subset_dynamic_import_computed_{ts,js}` stay
`STA1207`; gate unit admits a literal specifier and refuses a computed one.

## 157. `jsrt_call_protected` is the §4.9 mailbox used by a builtin (2026-09-02)

Phase 5 step 11. The missing piece `STA1216` named was never a second exception protocol: generated
C already checks `jsrt_pending()` after `jsrt_call` and jumps to a landing pad. A builtin cannot
jump to a pad it does not have. `jsrt_call_protected` is that same call plus take-on-pending, and
yields a `JSRTCompletion { value, threw }` so `then`/`catch`/`finally` and `new Promise(executor)`
can settle a promise with a handler throw instead of unwinding into library C. Documented as a
subsection of `docs/VALUE.md` §4.9.

Unlock in the same change: `Object.freeze`/`isFrozen` (a frozen bit; writes throw TypeError;
generated C checks pending after `jsrt_object_set` / `jsrt_set_prop`) and `toISOString` on an
Invalid Date (RangeError, pending check after the date-op). JSON/RegExp/string STA2005 panics are
re-dated rather than converted: the mechanism exists, each abort is its own golden-churn follow-up.
`seal`/`isSealed` still need a distinct [[Sealed]] bit.

Combinator residue: `allSettled`/`any`/`race`/`withResolvers`/`try` stay not-yet (`Promise.${name}`
from the static table miss). They need only this mechanism plus, for a non-array argument, step 8.

Check: `tests/golden/{ts,js}/promise_then.ts` match Node (`2 / x / f / 2 / 3 / boom / nope`);
`object_freeze.ts` and `date_invalid_iso.ts` match; decision tests `subset_promise_then_*` and
`subset_object_freeze_*` are `static`; gate unit admits then/catch/finally, `new Promise`, freeze.

## 158. Rest parameters are packed at the callee (2026-09-02)

Phase 5 step 12 family (a), first member. Call sites already pass extra arguments through
`jsrt_call`; a rest parameter is the callee packing `argv[from..]` into an array
(`jsrt_args_rest`). An empty rest is a fresh empty array, not `undefined`. Closure arity
(`Function.length`) excludes the rest parameter. Destructuring rest, defaults, optional
parameters, and destructuring declarations remain open in the same family.

Check: `tests/golden/{ts,js}/rest_params.ts` match Node (`6` / `10`); decision tests
`subset_rest_parameters_{ts,js}` out of expected-fail (static / dynamic).

## 159. Default and optional parameters (2026-09-02)

Phase 5 step 12 family (a), after rest. A default is an expression on the HIR `Parameter`; codegen
loads `jsrt_arg` and, when the value is `undefined`, evaluates the default into the same slot.
Optional `x?` is a missing argument with no initializer — `jsrt_arg` already yields `undefined`.
`Function.length` (`declaredArity`) stops at the first rest or default and still counts a bare
optional. Destructuring parameters, destructuring declarations, uninitialized `let`, and catch
destructuring remain open in the same family.

Check: `tests/golden/{ts,js}/default_params.*` and `optional_params.*` match Node; decision tests
`subset_default_parameters_{ts,js}` and `subset_optional_parameters_{ts,js}` (no expected-fail).

## 160. Uninitialized `let x;` is a slot that starts undefined (2026-09-02)

Phase 5 step 12 family (a). `Declaration.value` is optional; codegen writes nothing and the frame
slot is already `undefined`. TypeScript still rejects a typed read before a write (`STA0012`).

## 161. Shallow destructuring desugars to field and index reads (2026-09-02)

Phase 5 step 12 family (a). `const { x, y } = p` and `const [a, b] = arr` become one declaration
per name, plus an unspellable temporary when the RHS is not already an identifier. A `flatten`
block leaks those bindings to the enclosing statement list (a nested Block is a scope). Parameters
and `catch ({ message })` unpack the same way after a synthetic slot. Nested patterns, rest in a
pattern, and pattern defaults stay not-yet. A typed `catch ({ message })` is a TypeScript error
(`unknown` has no properties); js-mode catch destructure matches Node.

Check: `tests/golden/{ts,js}/destructure.*` match Node; object/array destructuring decision tests
out of expected-fail.

## 162. Release archives are thin-LTO bitcode when the linker can read them (2026-09-02)

The runtime's NaN-box accessors are `static inline` in `jsrt_value.h` and already inline into the
generated C, but every builtin call (`jsrt_array_push`, `jsrt_map_get`, string concat, shape
lookups) crossed the archive boundary as an out-of-line call. `just runtime` now probes
`-flto=thin` end to end (compile → `$AR` → link a bitcode archive) and, where it works, compiles
`build/` and `build-intl/` as bitcode and records the flag in `link-flags.txt`; `src/cli/build.ts`
reads it back, so its one clang call compiles the generated C to bitcode too and the link is one
module. The probe, not a guess, decides: ld64 and lld read bitcode archives, GNU ld only with the
LLVMgold plugin, and a wrong assumption is an unreadable archive on every compile. `build-asan/`
never uses LTO (sanitizer reports should name a line, and cross-module inlining blurs them). A
changed probe result or Boehm status now rebuilds every object (`build*/cflags.txt`): the timestamp
walk cannot see a flag change, and a mixed archive links fine while silently lacking what the flag
was for. `just runtime-test` links the print corpus from `link-flags.txt` instead of rediscovering
`-lgc` itself, which also removes a duplicate of the Boehm probe.

Measured here (Apple clang 21.0.0, arm64 macOS, Boehm 8.2.12, a 200k-element array/Map/string/
class loop ×20, best of 6, `GC_DONT_GC=1` so collection timing does not enter): 1262 ms → 1203 ms
(−4.7%); binary 72,536 → 88,024 bytes; the CLI's compile+link step 81 ms → 330 ms. Modest, and the
compile-time cost lands on every golden fixture; `tests/bench/baseline.json` compile times will
read high against this until re-recorded.

**Found while measuring, not fixed here:** the same program is nondeterministic and sometimes
segfaults with the collector on, in both the LTO and the plain build, and is deterministic and
matches Node with `GC_DONT_GC=1` — a live object is being collected. Each of the four loops alone
(array push/for-of, Map set/get, string `+=`, class instances in an array) runs clean; the
combination does not. Tracked as its own task; it predates this note.

Check: `just runtime` prints `thin LTO`, `file runtime/build/jsrt_ops.o` says `LLVM bitcode`,
`link-flags.txt` starts with `-flto=thin`; `pnpm run test:golden` and `just runtime-test` pass on
the bitcode archive; `just runtime-asan` reports `no LTO (sanitized build)`.

## 163. The roots hook replaced Boehm's stack scan instead of extending it (2026-09-02)

The nondeterminism note 162 found. Minimal failing pair: a Map filled with 200k `set`s over 5000
keys, then 20k string concatenations, twenty rounds — each loop alone was clean 8/8, the pair
failed 10/10, and always the same way: at the grow from 4096 to 8192 entries the map's `used`
collapsed to the inserts since the previous grow while `size` kept counting, so every key placed
before it was unfindable and got re-inserted (`size` 5008, 7048, 9096 in the golden runs; the
"+8" totals were `m.size` overshooting). A C harness that mirrors the pair and checks
`GC_base(m->entries)` after every insert caught the moment: inside `grow`, the freshly allocated
entries block — held only in the C local `entries` while the index was allocated — was on Boehm's
free list by the time the index allocation returned, and the next large allocation (a 40 KB
string, or the next grow) was carved out of it and zero-filled. `GC_is_marked` at every mark end
said the header, the old entries and the old index were marked: hook 1 and the frame roots were
doing their job. What was missing was the C stack.

Root cause: `GC_set_push_other_roots(jsrt_push_roots)` *replaces* the hook. In a threads-enabled
Boehm — every packaged one, Homebrew's and Debian's — the hook it replaces is `GC_push_all_stacks`,
which is the conservative scan of the C stack and registers (`mark_rts.c`: "in the threads case,
this also pushes thread stacks"). So since note 108 no raw pointer in a runtime local has been a
root. Everything reachable from a frame slot survived, which is why the corpus, the goldens and
the leak test stayed green; only a function that allocates twice and holds the first block in a
local across the second could lose it — `grow` (entries, then index), `jsrt_array_new` (header,
then elements), the iterator and promise constructors — and only when a collection landed between
the two, which took the string churn to provoke.

Fix: `jsrt_gc_init` saves `GC_get_push_other_roots()` and `jsrt_push_roots` calls it first, then
walks the frames. One static and three lines; the design in §4.12 is unchanged, it simply now
holds. The harness runs clean 20/20 rounds with the fix and fails within three rounds without it.
Not a rooting bug in generated code: the emitter already keeps every temporary in a slot, and
`--keep-c` on the reproducer confirms it.

Check: `tests/golden/ts/gc_roots.ts` (the four loops, twenty rounds, plus a per-key count check)
matches Node; before the fix it printed varying totals and died with SIGSEGV/SIGBUS about one run
in three. `pnpm run test:leak` still plateaus.


## 164. Expression-position residue is one family of HIR nodes, not a second lowering (2026-09-02)

Family (b) of Phase 5 step 12. The gate's leftover `describeKind` catch-alls were labels on a
block, value-position `++`/`+=`/`=`, `**` / `void` / comma / ternary / `in`, for-in, builtin
`instanceof`, and capturing a loop `let`. Each is now a node the HIR already had or a small
addition (`UpdateExpr`, `ConditionalExpr`, `Block.label`, `perIterationEnv`), not a mode-aware
special case below the gate.

Decisions that need a note rather than a comment:

- **Value-position assignment is `UpdateExpr` with `operator: '='`.** Statement position still
  folds to `Assignment`. The comma fixture `(n = 1, n + 1)` is why `=` cannot stay
  statement-only.
- **`instanceof Function` names a tag, not the constructor.** `Function` as a value is still
  STA1103/STA1206; the right operand of `instanceof` is not a global read (`isGlobalReference`).
- **Per-iteration environments skip `var`.** `for (var i)` is one function-scoped binding;
  cloning it made `tests/golden/js/var_hoist.js` disagree with Node (1\n2 vs 2\n2).
- **A `for` incrementor runs on the control env after the clone is committed.** Incrementing the
  clone itself left `() => i` seeing 1, 2, 3 after the loop. Node's 0, 1, 2 is the body snapshot.
- **The clone is the whole `JSRTEnv`.** Mixed shared+per-iter slots in one function env are an
  approximation; goldens keep the classic "only `i` is captured" shape, inside a function (a
  module-level `let` is a global, not an env slot).
- **A simple ternary still writes its frame slot.** Eliding the store for `c ? 1 : 2` left
  `JSRT_GLOBALS` larger than any `JSRT_GLOBAL(i)` write (`frames.test.ts`).

Not in this family: accessor compound (`o.x += 1` on a getter) stays (d); `#n in o` stays
not-yet; boxed `Error`/`Boolean`/`Number`/`String` have no representation, so `instanceof` them
answers false.

Check: `tests/golden/{ts,js}/expr_residue.*` match Node; subset family-(b) rows are out of
`@expected-fail`; `pnpm run test:subset` 322 fixtures, 0 failed.

## 165. Phase 6 evidence harnesses are offline-safe and pinned (2026-09-02)

Phase 6's runner surfaces are now present without adding a dependency: Test262 stores only its
corpus SHA and fetches into an ignored directory, the differential fuzzer uses xorshift32 seeds,
and the benchmark recorder retains the Phase 2 baseline while adding runtime/RSS/engine results.
The Test262 runner deliberately reports a visible skip when the corpus is absent, and treats an
unmapped feature tag as a failure. The nightly workflow derives its fuzzer seed from
`github.run_number`; it uploads findings and benchmark results rather than committing from CI.

The thin-LTO toy probe was a false positive on this host's pinned conda-clang 21.1.8/Darwin
linker: it accepted the toy archive but the real runtime archive aborted with `LLVM ERROR:
Unsupported stack probing method`. `justfile` therefore disables LTO on Darwin until a real
runtime/archive probe exists; Linux retains the probe. This is a compatibility guard, not a
semantics change to the runtime.

The owner policy for weekly results is **no CI write-back to `main`**: CI uploads the immutable
JSON artifact and the generated page; a deliberate owner-side commit is required for a result to
enter history. This avoids a bot commit racing feature work while preserving every measurement.

## 166. Runtime object stamps include the compiler identity (2026-09-02)

The incremental runtime build previously keyed `cflags.txt` only by flags. Switching the pinned
toolchain from Apple clang 21.0 to conda-clang 21.1.8 left stale ASan objects in `runtime/build-asan`;
the next link failed with `___asan_version_mismatch_check_apple_clang_2100`. The just recipe now
stamps the compiler's first version line along with both CFLAGS strings, forcing all objects to
rebuild when the compiler changes. This is required for sanitizer archives because the compiler
runtime ABI is part of the object contract even when source and flags are unchanged.

## 167. Darwin ASan uses Apple clang (2026-09-02)

The pinned conda-clang 21.1.8 sanitizer runtime never reaches `main` on this Darwin 25/26 host:
even a one-line ASan program hangs in `libclang_rt.asan_osx_dynamic.dylib` while initializing
shadow memory, and `sample` shows the sanitizer's static spin mutex waiting during dyld malloc
initialization. The same program and Stator's `print_numbers` corpus complete with Apple clang
21.0.0 from `/usr/bin/clang`; release builds remain on the pinned conda compiler. The ASan just
recipes and generated-C build therefore select Apple clang only when Darwin's compiler is the
default command name `clang`, while preserving an explicit compiler-path `CC` override. This is a host toolchain workaround,
not a runtime or semantics change.

## 168. Test262 async adapter must use the landed JS subset (2026-09-02)

The initial `tests/test262/harness/sta.js` declared `$DONE` as a named function expression. Stator
rejects named function expressions with STA1214, so every async Test262 test failed at compilation
before reaching its assertions. The adapter now uses an anonymous function, prints
`Test262:AsyncTestComplete` on successful `$DONE()`, and the runner requires that marker for
`flags: [async]`. A temporary pinned-style corpus test passes end to end.

## 169. JS-mode dynamic calls must reach the runtime (2026-09-02)

Test262 runtime-negative coverage exposed TypeScript diagnostic 2349 (`This expression is not
callable`) as another checker refusal that violates JS mode's untyped-code contract. It is now
suppressed alongside the dynamic property diagnostics, allowing an unknown callee to reach the HIR
and runtime's STA2006 TypeError path. A statically inferred number remains verifier-rejected; the
valid dynamic case is an untyped parameter, which is the intended boundary.

## 170. Test262 negative and expected-failure verdicts are explicit (2026-09-02)

Negative tests cannot rely only on error-name text: Stator compile diagnostics carry an STA code,
while runtime diagnostics may name a JavaScript class in their message. The runner now has an
explicit STA-to-class table (including STA0012 parse SyntaxError and the runtime TypeError/RangeError
cases), refusing to infer a class from an unmapped STA diagnostic. Known expected failures no longer
fail the job by themselves, but a pass, skip, or missing path makes the expectation stale and fails
the run.

## 171. Test262 adapter follows repository lint rules (2026-09-02)

The async `$DONE` adapter's anonymous function was semantically correct but Biome's
`useArrowFunction` rule made the Phase 6 lint Check fail. It now uses an arrow function, which is
also accepted by the JS-mode subset and preserves the completion-marker behavior.

## 172. Test262 standard frontmatter precedes execution metadata (2026-09-02)

The pinned `771005236e88a909635104e03ba12559688c0172` corpus puts every `/*---` block after a
copyright header, not at byte zero, and its 53,580 frontmatter-bearing tests standardly use
`description`, `info`, `author`, `es5id`, and/or `es6id` as well as execution metadata. The
original Step 6.1 wording, which allowed only six keys and required the block on line one, would
therefore reject every test before feature mapping. Step 2 now distinguishes standard descriptive
metadata (recognized but deliberately not interpreted) from execution metadata, still hard-errors
on an unknown *top-level* key, and explicitly reports the 294 legacy files with no frontmatter
rather than silently excluding them. This is a corpus-format compatibility correction, not a
relaxation of the corpus-bump tripwire.

## 173. Test262 corpus must be ignored by every local tool (2026-09-02)

The Step 6.1 text already required `tests/test262/corpus/` to be git-ignored, but `.gitignore`
omitted it. Fetching the pinned corpus therefore made 53,874 third-party files candidates for
Biome; `pnpm run format` then reached dynamic-import syntax that panics the installed Biome parser.
The path is now ignored. This makes the fetch destination the promised local cache, keeps format
and lint scoped to repository-owned files, and prevents accidental commits of the 50k-file corpus.
Biome has an explicit include allowlist, so it needs the matching `!tests/test262/corpus` exclusion
as well; `.gitignore` alone does not override that list. The runner's ignored `results.json` and
temporary directory need the equivalent exclusions too: a result is generated on every conformance
run and formatting it would make `pnpm run ci` fail after a successful offline/mini-corpus run.

## 174. Test262 feature tags map conservatively by full semantic surface (2026-09-02)

The pinned corpus exposes 198 distinct `features:` tags. Those tags are not one-to-one with
Stator's landed slices: for example, a tagged test may exercise typed-array, class-field, or
iterator semantics far beyond the subset's small, implemented form. `features.ts` now has a closed
generic `STA1214` list for every such tag, cited by a new `SUBSET.md` Test262 coverage row, instead
of treating it as supported because *some* related operation landed. The runner still errors on a
future unknown tag, retaining the corpus-bump tripwire. The map also uses own-property checks:
Test262's `__proto__` tag otherwise inherited `Object.prototype` and silently appeared supported.

## 175. The Test262 harness found two js-mode checks that reject valid JavaScript (2026-09-03)

Running the pinned corpus for the first time produced 98 failures in a 113-test slice, and every
one of them was the runner or the gate refusing the HARNESS, not the test:

1. **`tests/test262/harness/sta.js` shadowed the corpus file of that name.** Step 3 says a test is
   `harness/assert.js` + `harness/sta.js` + `includes:`. Those are corpus files; the corpus's
   `sta.js` is what defines `Test262Error` and `$DONOTEVALUATE`. Stator's adapter took the same
   name and defined only `$DONE`, so `assert()` threw a `Test262Error` that no longer existed and
   every harnessed test died on `Cannot find name 'Test262Error'`. The adapter is now
   `harness/done.js`, holds `$DONE` alone, and is concatenated *after* both corpus files. The name
   was the whole bug: a file named for a corpus file reads as that corpus file.
2. **`noFallthroughCasesInSwitch` and `useUnknownInCatchVariables` were on in js mode.** Both
   refuse *valid* JavaScript rather than *untyped* JavaScript, which is the line §1.2 draws
   ("untyped means dynamic, not rejected"). `formatIdentityFreeValue` in `assert.js` falls through
   on purpose, and `formatSimpleValue` reads `err.name` off a catch binding — the two most ordinary
   ES5 idioms there are. They now follow the `noImplicitAny`/`noImplicitOverride` precedent already
   in `program.ts` and are `mode === 'ts'`. ts mode keeps both: there a fallthrough is nearly always
   a missing `break`, and an `unknown` catch is §0.2's boundary rule.

This is Phase 5 step 2's residue, not new work — step 2 switched the *diagnostic table* by mode and
did not audit the *compilerOptions* for the same contract. The evidence is why the plan wants a
conformance suite: no decision fixture had asked either question, because both constructs are ones
nobody writes deliberately in TypeScript.

Two further runner changes came out of the same run:

- **A not-yet diagnostic on a positive test is a skip, not a failure.** §1.3 makes the never and
  not-yet ranges disjoint precisely so a test can tell intent from schedule, and step 4 already
  applies that rule to negative tests. A build that raised *nothing but* `STA12xx` is now a skip
  attributed to the lowest such code; a build that also raised anything else stays a failure, so
  the skip bucket cannot swallow a real refusal.
- **Unexplained failures are reported, not fatal.** At 53,874 tests a per-test `expected-fail.txt`
  cannot be the gate without becoming a file nobody reads, and an unreadable list explains nothing.
  The ratchet is the gate — that is what step 7's "monotonically tracked" means — and the runner
  prints a bounded sample plus the total so the failures stay visible.

Finally, the runner is now a pool over `availableParallelism()` (6.3× on this host: a 113-test
slice went 37 s → 5.9 s). That is not an optimization: a serial pass is ~5 hours, and step 8 asks
for a per-commit CI job. Temp filenames gained the pool slot — keyed by pid alone, two workers
would have compiled each other's source and reported the answer to the wrong test.

And the CI job the whole task exists to feed was reporting nothing. `pnpm run test262 2>&1 | tee
test262.log` makes `tee` the step's exit status, because `pipefail` is not on for a `run:` step —
so the ratchet could fail, the summary line could say anything, and the job would still be green.
That is precisely the failure mode §9's opening paragraph names, sitting in §9's own workflow.
Fixed with an explicit `shell: bash` + `set -o pipefail`, plus a `timeout-minutes` of its own so a
hung corpus pass looks hung instead of inheriting the six-hour default.

## 176. The first Test262 number, and the two skips that were not tests (2026-09-03)

The first full pass over the pinned corpus (53,874 files) read **1405 passed, 8212 failed, 44,257
skipped — 14.6%**. Two entries in that skip column were not conformance facts about Stator:

- **17,003 tests skipped on `flags: [generated]`.** INTERPRETING.md §"generated" says only that the
  file "was created procedurally using the project's [tooling]" — it is provenance, not a host
  capability, and it changes nothing about how the file is built or run. The adapter's
  `ALLOWED_FLAGS` did not list it, so the "flags the adapter does not implement are a SKIP" rule
  (step 3) silently retired **a third of Test262**. Step 3's rule is right; the flag was misfiled.
- **294 `_FIXTURE.js` files counted as skipped tests.** INTERPRETING.md: files bearing `_FIXTURE`
  "MUST NOT be interpreted as standalone tests" — they are imported *by* module tests. They have no
  frontmatter, so they landed in the `missing frontmatter` bucket, which is the bucket that is
  supposed to mean "a real test whose header we could not read". They are now excluded from
  enumeration; the one genuine headerless test
  (`Function/prototype/toString/line-terminator-normalisation-CR.js`) still reports as a skip.

Both are the same shape as the harness bug in note 175: **the skip column is where a runner's own
defects go to hide**, because a skip looks deliberate. Everything in it has to name a rule, and the
rule has to be about the compiler.

**What the failure column actually says.** 8212 failures, and `STA0012` — a TypeScript checker
refusal, not a Stator gate decision — is essentially all of them. The top buckets:

| count | diagnostic |
|---|---|
| 2861 | `'x' is possibly 'null'/'undefined'` |
| 805 | argument type not assignable to parameter type |
| 456 | cannot find name |
| 419 | object is possibly 'undefined' |
| 407 | implicitly has an 'any' type |
| 326 | type not assignable to type |

The largest bucket is one finding, and it is note 175's finding again at scale: **`strictNullChecks`
refuses ordinary JavaScript in js mode.** ~3400 of the 8212 are the possibly-null family. The fix is
NOT `strictNullChecks: false` — compilerOptions are program-wide, so that would also strip null
safety from the `.ts` half of a mixed graph and quietly delete the boundary checks §0.4 requires.
It is to suppress the possibly-null *diagnostic codes* in js mode the way 2339/2551/2353/2349
already are, leaving `T | undefined` in the type so the union still lowers to the dynamic path and
the check still happens — at run time, which is where a dynamic value's check belongs.

That is Phase 5 step 2 work, not Task 6.1 work, and it is recorded as such rather than folded in
here: this task's job is to publish an honest number and a ratchet, and it now has both plus a
measured, ordered backlog for the phase that owns the surface. Which is what §9 says the phase is
for — it produces evidence, not features.


## 177. The fuzzer's three unreachable regions, and the two defects that hid them (2026-09-03)

**Context.** `plan.md` §9 Task 6.2 step 4 names five regions the generator must weight toward,
"because everything else is already covered by fixtures": float formatting and the shortest
round-trip boundary, the `i32` refinement's overflow edges, string indexing across surrogate
pairs, `Map`/`Set` key identity (`-0`, `NaN`), and coercion order in `==`. The generator covered
the first two — `NUMBER_EDGES` carries both — and none of the last three.

**Two defects, not one gap.**

1. *Cross-type `==` was ungeneratable.* TypeScript's 2367 ("this comparison appears to be
   unintentional because the types have no overlap") fired in **js** mode, so `"" == 0` was a
   compile error. That is a lint about intent, and in JavaScript a cross-type `==` is not a
   mistake — it is the coercion table, which is most of what js mode exists to run. Suppressed in
   js mode alongside 2339/2551/2353/2349, which are the same judgement about a member rather than
   an operator. ts mode keeps it: there both operand types are known and disjoint, so the
   comparison cannot be anything but a bug. Pinned by the `subset_loose_equals_cross_type_{js,ts}`
   pair. This is the same finding as note 175 — the two checks there rejected *valid* JavaScript
   rather than untyped JavaScript — arriving a third time, which is why §8 step 2a exists.

2. *The time budget was shared, not split.* `--minutes=N` set one deadline for the whole run, so
   the first mode spent the entire budget and the second fell through to `count` cases — one, by
   default — and still printed a clean sheet. An hour-long nightly would have fuzzed `ts` for an
   hour, `js` for one program, and reported "0 divergences" for both. The arm that would have
   silently disappeared is `js`, which is step 8's whole subject. Now `budgetPerMode =
   minutes * 60_000 / modes.length`, with a fresh deadline per mode.

**What landed.** `IDENTITY_EDGES` (`NaN`, `Infinity`, `-Infinity`, `-0`, `0`) is deliberately
kept out of `NUMBER_EDGES`: arithmetic over those values mostly yields `NaN`, which would drown
the float-formatting region rather than add to it. The typed program now prints `text.length`,
`text.charCodeAt(i)`, an identity edge, and `1 / edge` — the last because `-0` and `0` print
alike in some positions and `-Infinity` vs `Infinity` is the cheapest way to tell them apart. The
dynamic program adds `Map`/`Set` construction over two identity edges (SameValueZero agrees with
neither `===` on `NaN` nor `==` on `-0`, so it is reachable only through the containers) and a
cross-type `==`. `Object.is` stays out: still `STA1214`, and step 3's rule is that a generated
program which fails to compile is a **generator** bug.

## 178. The fuzzer's first finding: lone surrogates were lost in the C source (2026-09-03)

**Divergence.** `const text: string = "\ud800"; console.log(text.charCodeAt(0));` — Node answers
`55296`, Stator answered `65533`. Seed 20260915, ts mode, found within seconds of the generator
gaining step 4's surrogate region (note 177). Minimized to two lines by `minimize.ts`.

**Cause, and where it was not.** The runtime is correct: `JSString` is `uint16_t data[]`, and
`jsrt_string_char_code_at` reads a code unit straight out of it. `utf8_decode` is already
WTF-8-tolerant — it never rejects the three-byte encodings of `D800..DFFF`. The loss was in the
**emitter**: `escapeString` copied non-ASCII source characters verbatim into the generated `.c`,
and writing an unpaired surrogate to a file as UTF-8 substitutes U+FFFD. By the time clang saw
the literal the code unit was already gone, so nothing downstream could have recovered it.

**Fix.** `wtf8Bytes` encodes the literal from its UTF-16 code units — pairing lead+trail into a
four-byte sequence, and encoding an unpaired surrogate as its own three-byte sequence — and
`escapeBytes` writes every byte outside printable ASCII as a **three-digit octal** escape. Octal,
not `\x`: a C hex escape consumes as many hex digits as follow it, so `"\xEDa"` is one
out-of-range character rather than two. The byte count passed to `jsrt_string_from_utf8` now comes
from that array rather than from `Buffer.byteLength(value, 'utf8')`, which was computing the
length of the *lossy* encoding — two bugs that happened to agree.

**Why this is the region step 4 named.** No hand-written fixture had a lone surrogate in it,
because nobody writes one on purpose; the golden suite had thirteen string files and every one of
them was well-formed. This is exactly the class the step calls "where a divergence is a semantics
bug rather than a typo", and it took the generator about one second to find once it could reach
it. Landed as `tests/golden/ts/string_surrogates.ts` with the pre-minimization program in
`tests/differential/corpus/` (step 7).

## 179. The leak test's plateau window was indexed, not anchored (2026-09-03)

`pnpm run ci` went red on `tests/leak` — `RSS climbed from 32 KB to 3024 KB — no plateau` — and five
consecutive reruns passed with the same peak (3008–3024 KB, ~5% of the 64 MB cap). Nothing leaked:
the middle third of the samples was still process STARTUP.

The plateau check compared `max(samples[n/3 .. 2n/3])` against `max(samples[2n/3 ..])`. That split
assumes the middle third is past startup, and the run is under a second with a 25 ms sampler, so
`ps` yields ~20 samples and one early sample landing at 32 KB makes the steady-state 3 MB tail read
as a 94× climb. The verdict depended on how many samples the scheduler let through before the heap
came up, which is a coin flip, not a measurement.

The window is now anchored on a VALUE: drop every sample before RSS first reaches half the peak,
then compare the halves of what remains. Same assertion — memory must stop growing — with a start
point the sampling rate cannot move. The cap check is untouched and is still the one that separates
"collected" from "never freed" (320 MB if nothing is ever freed, against a 64 MB cap).

Worth naming because of where it sat: a flaky red is the mirror image of the failure mode §9's
opening paragraph is written against. A green that proves less than it appears to teaches people to
trust a signal that is not there; a red that fires on jitter teaches them to re-run until it is
green, which costs the same signal by the other route.

## 180. The possibly-null family, and the two type sources that disagreed under it (2026-09-03)

**What landed.** plan.md §8 step 2a(a): the nine possibly-null diagnostic codes — 2531/2532/2533
(`Object is possibly …`), 2721/2722/2723 (`Cannot invoke an object which is possibly …`) and
18047/18048/18049 (`'x' is possibly …`) — are suppressed in js mode, joining 2339/2551/2353/2349
and 2367. They were **3855 of Task 6.1's 10,513 failures**, the largest bucket by a factor of three,
and every one of them is JavaScript that runs: `xs[i] + 1` is how the language indexes an array.

The suppression is of the CODE and never of the OPTION. `strictNullChecks: false` or
`noUncheckedIndexedAccess: false` is program-wide, so in a mixed graph it would strip null safety
from the `.ts` half and delete the boundary checks §0.4 requires. Leaving `T | undefined` in the
type is the point: the union lowers to the dynamic path, and the check still happens at run time.
The five-code `||` chain became an enumerated `JS_MODE_RUNTIME_CODES` set with a reason per line —
enumerated and not ranged, because an operation no runtime could settle must stay a hard error.

**Test262 moved: 10,513 failures → 9222, pass rate 18.5% → 20.5%, `passed` unchanged at 2379.**
That last clause is the honest half. The 1291 tests did not start passing; they stopped being
refused by a *checker lint* and are now refused by *Stator's own schedule* — they land in the skip
column attributed to an `STA12xx`, which is what §1.3's disjoint ranges are for. The pass number is
the one that says the compiler runs more JavaScript, and it did not move. What moved is the
attribution, and the next bucket is now visible underneath: `Argument of type 'X' is not assignable`
went 992 → 3233 as the tests that used to die on possibly-null reached their second diagnostic.
That re-measure is exactly what step 2a(b) asks for, and it is now recorded rather than predicted.

**The defect the suppression uncovered.** `/** @type {{a:number}|undefined} */ var box = {a:7};
box.a` compiled to `STA4060 no field 'a' on unknown` — an internal error, so a compiler bug by
`AGENTS.md`'s own definition. Two type sources disagreed about one expression:

- `typeAt(node)` answers with `checker.getTypeAtLocation`, the **narrowed** type at that use. CFA
  narrows `box` to `{a:number}` there, so `isClassInstance` said "object" and the branch that wants
  a field SLOT was taken.
- an identifier **lowers to its binding** — the declared type, `Unknown` — and the `boundary-check`
  that would reconcile the two is only inserted when the narrowing is one a tag can settle
  (`isCheckable`: number, string, boolean). An object-shape narrowing is not, so no check was
  inserted and the value stayed dynamic.

They agree on every narrowing that is checkable and disagree on every one that is not, which is why
nothing had noticed: a `.ts` program cannot get there (`unknown` narrowed to a shape is refused
before lowering) and no `.js` fixture had a JSDoc'd nullable object. The fix is in `typeAt`, the one
function every branch selection consults: when the identifier's binding is `Unknown` and the
narrowed type is not checkable, answer the binding. The value really is dynamic at run time — that
is a fact about the value, not a concession — so this is the truthful answer and not a workaround.
It returns the binding rather than a fresh `hUnknown(false)`, because an `Unknown` carries whether
it came from an implicit `any` and the verifier compares the two for equality (`js/destructure.js`
caught that within one run).

Worth recording separately: the comment at that site claims "the gate has already refused any
narrowing this cannot check (`isCheckable`)". It has not — `narrowedTo`/`isCheckable` are imported
by `src/lower/` and by nothing in `src/frontend/gate.ts`. The invariant was asserted in prose and
enforced nowhere, which is how the two readings drifted apart in the first place.

**Residue, named rather than hidden.** `xs[i].toFixed(2)` now compiles and then panics `STA2006` at
run time, because a method call on a *dynamic primitive* needs `Number.prototype` dispatch and the
runtime has no prototype chain (Phase 8 owns that surface). It is not a wrong answer — it is a
located abort — but it is not Node's answer either, so the golden fixture stays on the forms the
dynamic path can run and this line is the record that the gap is known.

## 181. A fixed shape had two orders and used one: reordering annotations miscompiled, spread was blocked (2026-09-03)

Found while landing plan.md §8 step 12 family (c). Reproduction, three lines of ordinary
TypeScript, no spread involved:

```ts
const o: { y: number; x: string } = { x: "s", y: 2 };
console.log(o.x);   // Stator: 2      Node: s
console.log(o.y);   // Stator: s      Node: 2
```

A silent wrong answer, not a diagnostic. The cause is that a fixed shape has **two** orders and the
compiler had conflated them:

- **Layout** — which slot a field lives in. `slotOf` resolves `o.x` by looking the name up in
  `target.type.fields`, so the layout is a property of the TYPE. Here that is the annotation's
  order, `y, x`.
- **Enumeration order** — what `console.log`, `Object.keys`, and `for…in` answer. §10.1.11
  OrdinaryOwnPropertyKeys says insertion order, which only the ALLOCATING LITERAL knows. Here that
  is `x, y`.

`registerShape` built the class descriptor from the literal's `entries` and the emitter stored
`entries[i]` into slot `i`, so writes used the literal's order while reads used the type's. Printing
was right by accident (the descriptor's names came from the same entries as the values), which is
why 140 golden fixtures passed: in every one of them the two orders coincided.

**Object spread makes them coincide never.** TypeScript's spread result type puts explicit
properties first: `{ ...base, y: 2 }` with `base: {x, z}` types as `{y, x, z}`, while JS builds
`x, z, y`. Measured, not assumed. So spread could not land on the fixed path until the two orders
were separated — which is the real reason family (c) had spread listed beside shorthand.

**The fix, at the layer that owns each fact.**

1. `JSRTClass` gains `key_order`: slot indices in insertion order, `NULL` when insertion order IS
   slot order (a class declaration lays fields out in the order it writes them, so it always is).
   `jsrt_class_key_slot` is the one accessor; `jsrt_print.c` and `jsrt_object_ops.c`'s `collect`
   are the only two walks that had to change.
2. The lowering takes the **contextual** type as the literal's layout when there is one, so the
   literal stores to the slots later reads resolve against. This is the same "the contextual type
   wins" rule `objectLiteralIsDynamic` already applies one line above.
3. The emitter stores each entry into its NAME's slot, not its position, and emits `key_order` from
   the entry order. The descriptor cache is keyed by shape name **plus** key order — one type with
   two insertion orders is two descriptors, or the second literal prints in the first's order.
4. The HIR verifier's check was "entry `i` is the shape's field `i`", which is exactly the
   conflation. It is now the invariant that survives: every entry names a field of the shape, and
   the literal covers the shape exactly.

Spread then falls out as pure lowering: `{ ...a }` expands to one `field-access` per field of `a`'s
shape. The gate holds the operand to an **identifier** — the expansion reads it once per field, so
anything with an effect would run that effect N times — and to a fixed shape. `{ ...a, x: 1 }`
needs no dedup rule: both entries resolve to one slot and the emitter stores in source order, so
the last write wins the way §13.2.5.5 says, and `keyOrderOf` keeps the key's first position.

**Residue in family (c), named rather than hidden.** A spread of a call result, a member access, or
a value with no fixed shape stays `STA1214`; methods and accessors in a literal stay `STA1214` (both
need calling through a shape the declaration does not build, and accessors need a get/set slot the
runtime has no representation for); computed keys stay `STA1214`.

## 182. JSDoc optionality is not a JavaScript parameter-order rule (2026-09-03)

TypeScript diagnostic **1016** (`A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter`) is now
suppressed in `js` mode only. Its premise is metadata: JavaScript parameters have no optional marker
and no signature-order rule, so a JSDoc declaration such as `@param {number=} first` followed by
`@param {number} second` executes with the ordinary positional calling convention. The matching
TypeScript spelling stays an `STA0012` error in `ts` mode.

The suppression is deliberately one code, not a relaxation of compiler options. The paired subset
fixtures and `tests/golden/js/required_after_optional.js` prove the distinction and the Node result.
It is the first individually judged item in plan.md §8 step 2a(b). The full Test262 pass from this
exact tree remained **2379 passed, 9222 failed, 41979 skipped**: it did not change the ratchet.
That is not an ineffective suppression. The runner classifies a TEST only after all its checker
diagnostics are considered, and each affected Test262 harness program still raises another
`STA0012` (for example the `PropertyDescriptor | undefined` argument mismatch). The old 1016 line
is absent; the test stays a failure for the next independently unsuppressed code. The plan's former
requirement that every code suppression move an aggregate test ratchet was therefore impossible
for multi-error programs; its Check now distinguishes a classifier-changing suppression from one
that merely exposes a later blocker, retaining the aggregate ratchet and requiring this per-code
evidence for the latter.


## 183. Function arity is runtime behavior in JavaScript (2026-09-03)

TypeScript diagnostic **2554** (`Expected N arguments, but got M`) is now suppressed in `js` mode only. The existing closure ABI already carries an argument count: extra values are ignored and `jsrt_arg` supplies `undefined` for an absent parameter, matching Node. A typed JS function call is therefore static after the checker refusal is removed; the TS-mode fixture retains `STA0012`.

The subset and golden fixtures cover both directions. The full pinned Test262 run from this tree passed with **2379 passed, 8839 failed, 42362 skipped**, ratcheting 383 tests from failure to a scheduled skip while retaining the pass count.


## 184. A checker-inferred binding must widen before JavaScript can reassign it (2026-09-03)

TS2322 is now suppressed in js mode only, but not as a bare diagnostic filter. The frontend records
the diagnosed binding symbol and passes that mode-free lowering policy downstream; lowering answers
`Unknown` for that symbol, so the HIR verifier sees dynamic assignment rather than the impossible
`number = string` pair. Module and nested-function fixtures prove the symbol identity survives scope.

The full pinned Test262 run is **2379 passed, 8444 failed, 42757 skipped**: 395 further failures
became scheduled skips, with passes unchanged.


## 185. JavaScript argument mismatch needs the callee’s coercion, not only a diagnostic filter (2026-09-03)

**What landed.** JS-mode TypeScript diagnostic **2345** (`Argument of type X is not assignable to parameter of type Y`) is now deferred. The paired function-call fixtures retain the ordinary `STA0012` error in ts mode, while `tests/golden/js/argument_mismatch.js` proves both a compiled function call (`increment("2")`) and `Math.abs("-3")` match the pinned Node.

**Blocker found before landing.** A bare 2345 filter made the Math example reach HIR, where the verifier raised `STA4080`: it asserted every `math-call` argument had HType `number`, despite the C signature accepting a boxed `jsrt_value`. Worse, the runtime then used `jsrt_number_value`, which reads a non-number’s NaN-box payload as a double. Removing only the verifier assertion would have made the compiler emit a wrong native program.

**Decision.** Math’s HIR contract is now exact arity plus a number result; operand coercion is runtime semantics. `jsrt_math.c` applies `jsrt_to_number` once in its shared argument helper, so every Math entry point implements ECMAScript `ToNumber` before numeric work. This preserves statically typed paths and makes a JS argument mismatch execute under JavaScript’s coercion rules. `runtime/include/jsrt_value.h` documents that contract.

**Evidence.** After `just runtime`, typecheck, lint, the subset matrix (**338 fixtures: 307 passed, 31 expected-fail**), the golden corpus (**145/145**) and runtime print corpus passed. The pinned full Test262 run moved from **2379 passed / 8444 failed / 42757 skipped** to **2379 passed / 7433 failed / 43768 skipped**. No passed test regressed; 1011 final classifiers became scheduled skips.


## 186. Arithmetic operand types are a JavaScript coercion question (2026-09-03)

**What landed.** JS-mode TypeScript diagnostics **2362** and **2363** — a non-numeric left or right arithmetic operand — are now deferred. The matching ts fixture retains `STA0012`; the js fixture and golden use `"3" - 1`, `1 - "3"`, and `"3" * 2`, all byte-for-byte against the pinned Node.

**Why this is safe.** This is not a new dynamic operation. `binary-op` already lowers subtraction and multiplication through the runtime’s ECMAScript numeric operators, which apply coercion to boxed operands. The diagnostic had been preventing a path whose runtime behavior was already implemented and independently verified.

**Evidence.** Typecheck, lint, subset (**340 fixtures: 309 passed, 31 expected-fail**) and golden (**146/146**) passed. The full pinned Test262 run moved from **2379 passed / 7433 failed / 43768 skipped** to **2379 passed / 7276 failed / 43925 skipped** — 157 final classifiers became scheduled skips, with no passed-test regression.


## 187. Owner-directed CLI tooling set: ink, execa, OpenTelemetry, dotenv (2026-09-04)

**Directive.** The owner directed, in one session and over the record's formal objection, four additions that all breach the §0.9 budget as written. This entry is the required plan-notes record (AGENTS.md: new dependencies need an entry) and plan.md §0.9 is amended in the same change.

**What landed and why.** (1) **ink + react** render the CLI's human-facing stdout/stderr through React components; machine output (`explain --json`) bypasses rendering entirely. Byte-exactness on pipes is preserved by two measured invariants in `src/cli/render.ts`: single-shot main-region render + immediate unmount (a `<Static>` tree was spiked to double-write on pipes), and color keyed on `stream.isTTY` only. oclif's useful conventions came WITHOUT @oclif/core: per-command `--help` and long-form flags (`--out`, space-form `--mode`). (2) **execa** (dev-only) replaces `spawnSync` in CLI tests; `stripFinalNewline: false` is mandatory — its default ate a fixture assertion. (3) **OpenTelemetry** (`@opentelemetry/api`, `sdk-trace-node`, `exporter-trace-otlp-http`, `resources`) traces the pipeline stages (`frontend/program`, `gate`, `module-graph`, `lower`, `passes/optimize`, `hir/verify`, `codegen/emit-c`, `link/clang`) plus a root span per command. Opt-in via `STATOR_OTEL`; the standard `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`/`_HEADERS` envs make it work with Maple and any OTLP backend. SDK imports are dynamic so default startup is untouched (startup floor is a bench metric). Init failure degrades to a stderr warning, never a failed compile. (4) **dotenv** loads `.env` before telemetry init, with `quiet: true` — v17 otherwise logs to stdout, which would break byte-exact output. `@types/react` accompanies react.

**Cost accepted by the owner.** Every CLI spawn now pays the ink/react import (~tens of ms per process; the subset suite runs hundreds of spawns). **[Corrected by note 189: measured at ~1.6 s, not tens of ms — 50× this estimate. The import is now lazy (inside `print`), which is what keeps this acceptance defensible; the rest of this entry stands.]** `tests/bench/baseline.json` predates this and should be re-recorded on the owner machine. The five native cli.test failures seen during the session were a pre-existing `mise trust` gap, not this work.

**Verification state at write-time.** typecheck, lint, and the execa-based CLI unit suite are green; the subset/golden suites and a telemetry export test are written down as remaining work — this entry was committed before they ran.

**Verification completed (final, under the pinned Node 26.7.0).** The earlier in-session numbers were gathered under node 24.20.0 — the shell's PATH resolved mise's `node/lts` install dir before the shims, so `node` answered 24 until `mise which node` was prefixed onto PATH; every "green" claim before that fix is retried below on the pin, and the golden runner compares against `process.execPath`, meaning the pre-fix runs diffed against node 24 itself. The exit-9 CI failure was exactly this: `--test-coverage-include-all` needs Node ≥26. The correct invocation on this host is `export PATH="$(dirname "$(mise which node)"):$PATH"` (or `mise exec node --`) before any suite. Pinned-Node results: typecheck + lint clean; `node --test tests/unit/*.test.ts` **367/367** (incl. `telemetry.test.ts` 3/3); `pnpm run test:coverage` **90.04% src lines** (telemetry.ts 42–43, the catch arm, uncovered); `pnpm run test:subset` **342 fixtures — 311 passed, 31 expected-fail, 0 failed**; `pnpm run test:golden` **147/147** (a fixture added by a concurrent session since the first run; pre-fix numbers 340/146 were that session's earlier tree, not Node skew); `pnpm run test:asan` **147/147** under the sanitized runtime; `pnpm run dupes` **0.9%**; leak loop plateaus at **3024 KB RSS**; `test:runtime` corpus matches Node. The measured invariants held: `explain --json` unchanged on pipes with `STATOR_OTEL=1`, and every suite spawning the CLI hundreds of times matches Node byte-for-byte. `tests/bench/baseline.json` re-record remains open for the owner machine (recorded above as accepted cost).


## 188. The no-network constraint is stale, and Phase 8 step 3's acquisition clause contradicted itself (2026-09-04)

**What was believed.** Note 28 (2026-08-29) recorded that this environment has no network access,
which is why Ryū was never vendored. Three live sites inherited it: plan.md §11 Phase 8 step 3
("this environment has no network (plan-notes 28), so the source has to arrive by the same route
the existing vendor drop did"), plan.md §12 rung 1 (mimalloc/jemalloc: "a vendor drop … under the
no-network constraint"), and `docs/TOOLCHAIN.md`'s Ryū row.

**Measured, 2026-09-04.** `fetch()` of the exact file Phase 8 step 3 needs, at the exact commit
`runtime/vendor/quickjs-ng/VENDOR.md` pins:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quickjs-ng/quickjs/1ab8676f4b6d6d669baeb5f21790fb9734636a20/quickjs.h
→ HTTP 200, 66,272 bytes
```

This is not new as of today: Task 6.1 (2026-09-03) fetches the Test262 corpus by SHA over the same
transport and produced the pinned conformance numbers with it. The constraint had already been
falsified by work in the tree; nobody went back and said so, which is drift of exactly the kind
§15.3 exists to catch.

**The self-contradiction it left behind.** Step 3's clause says the source "has to arrive by the
same route the existing vendor drop did" *because* there is no network — but that route is
`runtime/vendor/update.mjs`, whose `fetchText`/`raw` pair is an HTTPS fetch from
`raw.githubusercontent.com`. The sentence forbids the network and then points at the network. An
agent reading it either stalls on an acquisition problem that does not exist or invents an
undocumented route, which §15.6 calls a plan bug rather than a coding decision.

**Edited in this change.** Step 3's acquisition clause now names the script and the one thing that
is actually constrained — `quickjs.c`/`quickjs.h` must come from the SAME commit as the vendored
`libregexp`/`libunicode`, or the interpreter's own copies are duplicate symbols at link time. §12
rung 1's parenthetical drops the constraint and keeps the rule that survives it (a `VENDOR.md`-pinned
vendor drop, never a package fetch, because the pin is what makes the version auditable — that was
never about reachability). `docs/TOOLCHAIN.md`'s Ryū row now says Ryū is **fetchable and not yet
fetched**, which is a scheduling fact, not an environmental one.

**What this does NOT do.** It does not open Phase 8. The phase's gate is step 1 — a written,
owner-approved record of which users are blocked on which untyped dependency or `eval` site — and
no such record exists in the tree (no tag but `phase-0-approved`, nothing in `NICHE.md` or `docs/`).
Network availability removes an *implementation* obstacle from step 3; it has no bearing on the
gate, and "do not build speculatively" is unchanged.

**Follow-up now unblocked and unclaimed:** Ryū. Note 28 kept the swap contained to the body of
`shortest_digits()` on purpose, so vendoring it is a one-function change against a corpus that
already passes byte-for-byte. It costs up to 18 `snprintf`+`strtod` pairs per number printed today,
and §15.4 lists "Ryū-exact number printing" as a settled decision. Owner's call whether that becomes
a task now or rides §12.

## 190. The plan's six unmade decisions, made (2026-09-04)

> **Numbered 190, not 189.** This entry was drafted as 189 and renumbered before landing:
> `docs/SUBSET.md` row "Object literals with optional properties" already cited **plan-notes 189**
> for the `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` js-mode codes (2375/2379/2412), whose fixtures were in the
> tree uncommitted while this was written — a concurrent claim on the number. The later writer
> moves and nothing is renumbered retroactively, which is how entry 115 handled the same collision.
> 189 therefore belongs to that work and arrives after this one.

**The finding.** `plan.md` and `plan-notes.md` carried six places where the plan tells its reader
to decide something *before* proceeding, and none of the six had an answer anywhere in the tree.
They are not one kind of thing — two are technical representations, four were reserved to the
owner — but they share a shape worth naming: a deferral written as an instruction, which reads as
scheduling and behaves as a stall. §15.6 says a task that leaves you guessing is a plan bug; these
are the plan telling you, in advance, that you will be left guessing, and then not fixing it.

Two of the six gate work that is open **right now** (§8 step 12's families (c)/(d) and (e) are two
of the four remaining items in the open phase). One had been unresolved since 2026-08-29 and said
in its own text that it had to be settled before the next task started.

**The inventory, and where each one lived.**

| # | Blocker | Site | Gated |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Node pin: 26.7.0 (Current) or 24.x LTS | plan.md §4; notes 9, "**Unresolved.**" | Phase 6 Task 6.2 fuzzing — the differential ground truth |
| 2 | Accessor get/set representation | plan.md §8 step 12(c): "decide it in `docs/VALUE.md` before writing any of it" | §8 step 12(c) residue and all of (d) |
| 3 | Bound-method representation | plan.md §8 step 12(e): "Decide the bound-method REPRESENTATION in `docs/VALUE.md` before writing any of it" | §8 step 12(e), 5 gate sites |
| 4 | CI committing bench results to `main` | plan.md §9 Task 6.3 step 6: "a repo-policy decision for the owner" | Task 6.3 step 6 |
| 5 | Ryū: a task now, or §12 | notes 188 tail: "unclaimed … Owner's call" | nothing, but unclaimed |
| 6 | Computed-specifier `import()` owner | plan.md §11 step 7: "only if step 10's owner-confirmed split still says so" | `STA1207`'s residue |

**1 — the Node pin stays 26.7.0.** Task 1.0 step 2 said "current Node **LTS**" and 26.x is
Current, so the letter of the plan argues for 24.x. Everything else argues against: the pin has
been the differential ground truth since 2026-08-29, and three artefacts are now measured against
it — 146 golden fixtures byte-for-byte, the Test262 ratchet (2379 / 7276 / 43,925), and
`tests/bench/baseline.json`. Moving re-baselines all three, and Node 26 enters LTS this October
anyway, so the divergence from the wording is six weeks long. `.node-version` and `mise.toml`
already agree on 26.7.0; nothing in the tree changes. plan.md §4's "Open follow-up" paragraph
becomes the recorded answer and notes 9's **Unresolved** is struck.

**2 — accessors are a get/set pair on a shape entry (`docs/VALUE.md` §4.15).** The blocker's own
wording — "a get/set **slot** the value model has no representation for" — points at the wrong
answer twice over. A slot per accessor per object is one closure per accessor per instance, which
is exactly what §4.5 refuses for methods; and the premise that a representation was missing is
half false, because `docs/SUBSET.md`'s "Classes with getters/setters" row is **implemented** as of
rung 6b — an accessor is a pair of methods under a name no source can spell, and the property
occupies no slot. Step 12(d)'s class residue is dispatch and naming, not representation.

What genuinely had no answer is the OBJECT-LITERAL case, and Node says why the two cannot share
one: a class accessor is on the prototype and does not print (`C {}`, `Object.keys` `[]`), while a
literal's is an own property and does (`{ x: [Getter] }`, keys `['x']`).

**The first draft of §4.15 got this wrong and it is worth recording why.** It gave `JSRTClass` a
new nullable `accessors` array indexed by slot — a fresh mechanism, invented while
`docs/SUBSET.md`'s "Getters/setters on object literals" row already carried a verdict for exactly
this case: `dynamic`, "property access routes through the descriptor". SUBSET.md is the row
authority (plan.md §16 v2.1), so inventing a competing design in `docs/VALUE.md` would have put
two documents in conflict on a construct neither had built yet. Corrected before landing: a
literal containing an accessor builds Task 4.1's `JSRTDynObject` shape table, for the reason row 84
already gives for optional properties — a fixed shape's reads compile to slot indices decided at
build time, and an accessor has no slot to index. `JSRTClass` gains nothing; the fixed-slot path
keeps its layout, its two orders and its branch-free read. The shape entry holds either a slot
index or a `JSRTAccessor *` (both halves, never a function plus a flag — the inspector prints
three forms), and the shape table is insertion-ordered by construction, so `Object.keys` and the
inspector get the measured order with no second order to maintain (entry 181 is what a second
order costs). Stated cost: an accessor deoptimizes its whole literal, so a sibling data property
becomes an IC lookup — row 84's trade, taken for row 84's reason.

Static accessors need no representation at all: statics are bindings, not slots (entry 65).
Computed and `#private` accessor names stay `STA1214`. Property attributes and `defineProperty`
stay Phase 8's — a `JSRTAccessor` is two function pointers, not a property descriptor.

**3 — there is no bound closure, and that is the decision (`docs/VALUE.md` §4.16).** Five gate
sites and plan.md both call this "a bound closure nothing here builds", and step 12(e) warns it is
where an accidental second closure representation gets built. The warning is right and the premise
is wrong: **`const f = o.m` does not bind in JavaScript.** `f()` gives `this === undefined` in
strict mode, and class bodies and modules are always strict. A receiver-capturing closure would be
a divergence from Node, not a missing feature. What the runtime already has is enough — a method
is emitted as an ordinary unit with the receiver as parameter zero (§4.5) and every callee reads
parameters through `jsrt_arg`, which answers `undefined` for a parameter no call supplied (§1.1),
so `jsrt_call(m_closure, 0, NULL)` computes the spec's answer with no allocation and no adapter.
Identity comes out right for free (`o.m === o.m` is `true`, because both read the same file-scope
constant — Node's answer too, since both read the same prototype method); an allocated adapter
would have made it `false`. Three things still get paid for, none a representation: a method's
`arity` must not count the receiver (`declaredArity` runs over `fn.params`, whose slot zero is the
receiver — `Function.prototype.length` is unobservable today, which is why it is cheap now and a
bug to inherit); a virtual method's value loads `jsrt_method(recv, slot)`, the choice `method-call`
already makes; and `this` being `undefined` must raise Node's `TypeError` through §4.9's pending
cell rather than abort. The second representation is reserved for `Function.prototype.bind` — the
only construct in the language that creates a bound function — and is specified in advance as a
two-slot `JSRTEnv` plus one shared thunk, so it cannot arrive as a new struct. A builtin method in
value position (`const f = m.get`) stays not-yet on purpose: a builtin is not a `JSRTClosure` at
all, and giving each one a closure constant is a per-member code-size cost with nothing waiting on
it.

**4 — CI does not commit benchmark results to `main`.** Owner's answer. The weekly job uploads
`tests/bench/results/<ISO-date>-<host-id>.json` as an artifact and writes to
`$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`; no write-scoped token, no bot commits on the default branch. Consistent
with what the harness already is: `baseline.json` is explicitly machine-local (§12), so the
authority for a committed result is the person who ran `bench:record` on the machine it describes,
not a runner. Task 6.3 step 6 records it and step 5's generated `README.md` follows the same rule.

**5 — Ryū rides §12.** Owner's answer, closing entry 188's unclaimed follow-up. §15.4 has it
settled as a decision and `docs/TOOLCHAIN.md` now has it as fetchable-and-unfetched; what was
missing was only *when*. It is a pure speed change — `shortest_digits()` costs up to 18
`snprintf`+`strtod` pairs per number printed, against a corpus that already matches Node
byte-for-byte — so there is no correctness argument for jumping §12's entry criterion, which is a
measured before/after on a harness that does not exist yet. Recorded in §12 beside that criterion
rather than left in a notes entry nobody reads for scheduling.

**6 — the computed specifier of `import()` is Phase 8's, confirmed.** §11 step 7 said it lands
there "only if step 10's owner-confirmed split still says so", and no such confirmation existed:
entry 156 assigned it on the implementer's judgment and step 10 then closed against that
assignment. So `STA1207`'s residue read as an open question for two days while the work that
depended on it was already done — a conditional pointing at a confirmation nobody had been asked
for. Confirmed: a computed specifier needs runtime module resolution, which is a runtime module
system, which is what the dynamic tier is. The clause is dropped.

**Also struck in this change.** The "Open items carried forward" block above entry 66 still listed
"Phase 0 is not approved" and "No commits exist yet" as live. Phase 0 closed 2026-09-01 and the
tree has been committed since 2026-08-30. The block's third item was already struck through with
"resolved, see entry 12", so the convention was there and the other two had simply outlived it.

**plan.md edited:** yes — §4 (the pin), §8 step 12(c) and (e) (both now pointing at the decided
`docs/VALUE.md` sections), §9 Task 6.3 step 6, §11 step 7, §12 (Ryū), and §16 v4.0.
`docs/VALUE.md` gains §4.15 and §4.16; `docs/TOOLCHAIN.md`'s Ryū row gains the schedule.

**Evidence for 2 and 3, measured on the pinned Node v26.7.0** — both decisions rest on claims
about Node's output, and §15.5 says a number you did not produce is not evidence:

```
$ mise exec -- node -e '...'
literal   : { x: [Getter], y: [Setter], z: [Getter/Setter] } [ 'x', 'y', 'z' ]
class     : C {} []
identity  : true true          # o.m === o.m , p.m === o.m
this      : undefined          # const f = o.m; f()
TypeError : TypeError | Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '#n')
node      : v26.7.0
```

Line 1 and 2 are why accessors cannot share one answer across literals and classes, and the
three printed forms are why `JSRTAccessor` carries both halves rather than a function plus a flag.
Lines 3–5 are the whole of decision 3: identity is `true` on both comparisons (so an allocated
adapter would be observably wrong), `this` is `undefined` (so auto-binding would be observably
wrong), and touching `this` from an unbound method value is a `TypeError` — which §4.16 requires
to come through §4.9's pending cell rather than an abort.

**Check.** No code changed, so the runnable check is that the tests which read these documents
still pass: `mise exec -- node --test tests/unit/phases.test.ts` → `pass 4, fail 0` (it pins
`src/support/phases.ts` to what `done.md` records, and §16 gained an entry in this change).

**No code changed.** Every one of the six was a decision the plan had deferred, and the deliverable
is the decision written where the implementer will look for it. Implementing §4.15 and §4.16 is
§8 step 12's own work and lands with that step's fixtures and Check.

## 191. Session follow-ups: the PATH hazard (Node 24 answering for the pin), and the builtins dashboard drifted RED (2026-09-04)

**Context.** This session finished plan-notes 187's written-down remaining work (the subset/golden
suites and the telemetry export test) and then ran the full CI gate. Two findings came out of it
that are follow-up work, not fixes made in place — the user directed they be recorded in the plan
and the session stopped.

**Finding 1 — the PATH hazard is itself a green-signal hazard, and it bit this session.** The host
shell's `PATH` puts mise's `node/lts` install directory (`…/installs/node/lts/bin`, v24.20.0) ahead
of the shims, so bare `node`/`pnpm` answer **24.20.0** while `.node-version`/`mise.toml` pin
**26.7.0**. `mise exec node --` and `mise current` both report 26.7.0 — the hazard is only in
shell PATH ordering, and a bare `pnpm run ci` in this shell runs on the WRONG node. Consequences
measured this session: `--test-coverage-include-all` exits 9 (needs ≥26) and the golden runner
compares against `process.execPath` (node 24), i.e. pre-fix "green" runs diffed against a Node
that is not the ground truth. A suite green under 24 is not evidence about 26 — the node-24 run of
`test:golden` "passed" 146/146 against node 24's own output, while the honest pinned-Node run is
**147/147** (a fixture had been added by a concurrent session; pre-fix counts differ from
post-fix). The record's existing note (187's "mise trust gap") misattributed the mechanism: the
`mise trust` state was never in question — `mise which node` resolves correctly; the PATH order is.

**Finding 2 — the builtins dashboard drifted red, hiding landed work.** The dashboard
(`tests/golden/builtins.ts` + `builtins_coverage.json`) exists to keep coverage claims honest both
ways: stale GREEN claims fail the run (the file-exists + source-mentions checks). But the RED
direction has no check at all — a member implemented and golden-proved can sit in the table as
`[]` indefinitely. Measured: `Promise.prototype.then/catch/finally` **landed 2026-09-02**
(plan-notes 157, commit `b8a0ac8`, golden `tests/golden/js/promise_then.js` passing in the 147/147)
yet the table still lists all three as `[]` — so `pnpm run test:builtins` reports
`Promise.prototype: 0/3 (0%) — missing: then, catch, finally`, hiding two days of landed work
behind what reads as an open-task line. `Object.freeze`/`isFrozen` are the same shape: §7's exit
note says they → Phase 5 step 11 (landed, plan-notes 157); `tests/golden/ts/object_freeze.ts`
exists and passes, and the js-column twin `tests/golden/js/` has **no** freeze fixture — so
`Object: 7/13` also under-reports. Nobody updated the JSON when step 11 landed; the dashboard
cannot catch its own red drift, and the phase-5 step-11 unlock sweep's fixtures were never
reflected in the table.

**Why these go in the plan rather than being fixed now.** The user's instruction was to record the
follow-up and stop. Both are small, self-contained, and next-session work:

1. **Pin the invocation.** Either `package.json` scripts must guard the Node major (fail fast if
   `node -p process.version` isn't 26+ before running suites), or `mise exec node --` must be baked
   into every script that spawns Node (the `ci`/`test*` family), or a `just` recipe must wrap it.
   Cheapest correct: a preflight check in `ci.sh`/`package.json` that compares `node --version`
   against `.node-version` and fails with a one-line remediation. Also record the
   `export PATH="$(dirname "$(mise which node)"):$PATH"` remediation in AGENTS.md's Commands
   preamble.
2. **Fix the dashboard's red-drift direction.** `Promise.prototype.then/catch/finally` →
   `["ts/promise_then.ts", "js/promise_then.js"]` (mirroring how `Promise.all`/`resolve`/`reject`
   cite both fixtures); `Object.freeze` → `["ts/object_freeze.ts", …]` — but the js-column twin
   needs WRITING first (only the ts fixture exists today) so the claim's two fixtures both exist
   and mention it; `isFrozen` likewise (mentioned by the ts fixture's source). Land a fix that
   does not just hand-fix these two rows but makes red-drift detectable: e.g. a unit test that
   greps `runtime/src/*.c` for `jsrt_<ns>_<member>` exported symbols and cross-checks the table —
   an implemented-and-exported member with an empty claim is the smell. The alternative (a
   dashboard-only unit test) leaves the JSON unverifiable.
3. **Re-record `tests/bench/baseline.json`** on the owner machine (187's accepted cost, still open).
4. **Telemetry coverage**: `telemetry.ts` lines 42–43 (the catch arm) remain the only uncovered
   lines in `src/` (90.04% overall). Cheap to cover by a unit test that makes the dynamic import
   fail (e.g. point `STATOR_OTEL` at an import that throws).
5. **commit `b8a0ac8`'s step-12c-mate** — golden fixture pair `promise_then.ts` **exists** but is
   not cited by `builtins_coverage.json` (both the ts and js fixtures exist and pass) — same as
   item 2's first clause, listed once here for the commit-scan's benefit.
6. **Settled by plan-notes 190** (no action): the Node pin stays 26.7.0 and accessors/method-values
   representations are decided — items 1–2 above are process fixes, not re-opened decisions.

**Where in plan.md.** Finding 1 → a new task under §9 Phase 6 (it is harness-honesty work, exactly
this phase's theme: "a green signal that proves less than it appears to"); finding 2 → a follow-up
under §8's step 12 (it is Phase-5-surface bookkeeping). Both carried into plan.md by this entry.
The dashboard claim fix (items 2/5) belongs to step 12's family work and lands with those commits;
the PATH guard (item 1) is Task 6.3-adjacent harness work and lands standalone.

## 189. The test harness was serial, and `ink` cost 1.6 s on every compiler spawn (2026-09-04)

**Ask.** Owner: "Optimize test runs. Make multi tread or parallel runs. Or install tools for tests.
Should pass more fast."

**Finding 1 — two of the three spawn-heavy runners were serial.** Task 6.1 built a process pool for
`tests/test262/run.ts` because a serial conformance pass is ~5 hours. `tests/subset/run.ts` and
`tests/golden/run.ts` have the identical shape — hundreds of independent `stator` spawns — and were
still `spawnSync` in a `for` loop. Nothing about them required it; the pool was simply never lifted
out of the runner that needed it first.

The fix is extraction, not a third copy (AGENTS.md: find the existing helper, or extract one shared
helper at the responsible layer). `tests/support/parallel.ts` now owns `runProcess` and `pool`, and
the test262 runner imports them instead of defining them. Net **−19 lines** across the three
runners, and `pnpm run dupes` stayed at 0.9% against its 1% ceiling.

Two invariants are carried in that file's header because both were learned the expensive way in
Task 6.1 and neither is visible at a call site:

- **Results are indexed by ITEM, never by completion order.** A pool finishes out of order by
  construction, so a runner that pushed as it went would emit a different failure list on every run
  and a different `results.json` on every commit. Ordering the output is what keeps a parallel run's
  report diffable against a serial one's — which is the only reason the comparison below is
  meaningful at all.
- **Nothing is keyed by pid.** Two workers in one process share a pid, so a pid-keyed temp file
  would have each compiling the other's source and reporting the answer to the wrong test. Callers
  get `slot`; `mkdtemp` (what the golden runner already used) is the other correct answer.

`STATOR_TEST_JOBS=1` forces the serial order back. It exists so a failure that *looks* like the pool
can be checked against a serial run without stashing — which is not a safe operation in a worktree a
second session is editing — and it is the knob a shared CI box needs anyway.

**Finding 2 — plan-notes 187 was 50× wrong about `ink`.** That entry accepted ink on the estimate
that importing it costs "tens of ms". Measured on this machine it is **~1.6 s**, and `src/cli/main.ts`
paid it at module scope on *every* process. Neither `explain --json` nor a successful `build` ever
renders anything — the CLI's own test spawns were paying 1.6 s for a module they never called.

Moving the import inside `print` (`await import('ink')`) cut per-spawn cost **2349 ms → 843 ms
(2.8×)**. It forced `print` async, and with it `build`/`explain`/`run` — `require()` cannot load an
ESM graph with top-level await, so the lazy form has to be the async one. `src/support/telemetry.ts`
gained `withSpanAsync` in the same change: the sync `withSpan` ends the span the moment an async
function returns a pending promise, so reusing it would have silently reported near-zero build times.
No output changes — golden compares stdout *and* stderr byte-for-byte and stayed 147/147.

**Measured, uncontended, this machine (`availableParallelism()` = 16).** Both columns already carry
the ink fix, so this isolates the pool:

| Suite | `STATOR_TEST_JOBS=1` | pooled | speedup |
|---|---|---|---|
| `test:subset` (342 fixtures) | 109.7 s | 17.4 s | **6.3×** |
| `test:golden` (147 fixtures) | 151.0 s | 44.5 s | **3.4×** |

Golden gains less because each fixture runs `clang` and then two binaries, so it is closer to
CPU-bound where subset is dominated by per-spawn Node startup — exactly the cost finding 2 attacked.

**No dependency was added.** The ask offered "install tools for tests"; the pool is `node:child_process`
plus `availableParallelism()` from `node:os`, so the runtime dependency budget is untouched and no new
entry is owed under the AGENTS.md dependency rule.

**Where in plan.md.** Finding 2 corrects the cost estimate recorded in note 187; that entry's
conclusion (ink is accepted, confined to `src/cli/`) is unchanged — only its arithmetic was wrong,
and the lazy import is what makes the acceptance hold. Neither finding changes a Check.

## 192. Object-literal accessors: the pair belongs in the object's slot, not on the shape (2026-09-04)

**Context.** plan.md §8 step 12(c)'s residue, implemented against `docs/VALUE.md` §4.15 — the
section entry 190 wrote to unblock it. Two things in that section were wrong when the code met it,
and one hole opened that the section did not anticipate. All three are recorded here because each
was found by evidence, not by reading.

**Correction 1 — a shape cannot hold the pair.** §4.15 as written by entry 190 put the get/set pair
on the `JSRTShape` entry, beside the slot offset. That is unimplementable, and Node says why:

```
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) out.push({ get x() { return i; } })
  → three objects, ONE shape (same key, same history), THREE getters (each captured a different i)
```

A shape is shared by every object with the same key history; a getter can capture. Aliased getters
would have been the result. The pair therefore lives in the object's **slot**, as a
`JSRTAccessorCell` — prefix-shared with `JSRTObject` exactly as `JSRTMap` and `JSRTDynObject` are,
so the Object tag covers it and the descriptor pointer (`&jsrt_class_accessor`) is what says which
builtin it is. `JSRTShape`, `JSRTIC` and `JSRTClass` are all **unchanged**: a property read tests
the value it just loaded. Nothing in the language can construct a cell —
`jsrt_define_accessor` is the only producer — which is what makes that test unfoolable.
§4.15 was corrected in the same change; entry 190's conclusion (accessors deoptimize to Task 4.1's
dynamic path, `JSRTClass` gains nothing) is unaffected.

**Correction 2 — `isDynamicShape` refused what it should trigger on.** `src/frontend/types.ts`
returned `false` for any anonymous shape with a Get/SetAccessor member, lumping accessors in with
methods. Both halves of that were load-bearing and wrong once accessors had a representation:

- `shapeTypeToHType` built a LAYOUT for `{ get at(): number }` — field `at` at slot 0 — so a read
  through such a type compiled to `jsrt_object_get(o, 0)` on a `JSRTDynObject`. Measured: the
  compiled program printed `2e-323` (a raw slot word read as a double) where Node printed `0`.
- `isDynamicShape` answered "not dynamic", so the gate and the lowering disagreed with the literal
  about which representation the object had.

An accessor is now a **trigger** alongside an optional property and an index signature, and a
method is still a refusal (calling through the shape table is step 12(e)). The rule that follows:
an accessor deoptimizes its whole shape, siblings included — one object cannot be half a layout.
This is the trade `docs/SUBSET.md` row 84 already accepts for optional properties.

**The hole that opened: a fixed-shape position.** TypeScript calls `{ get at(): number }`
assignable to `{ at: number }`. It is not representationally: the literal must be a `JSRTDynObject`
to hold the pair, while every later `o.at` is typed by the annotation and compiles to a slot load
on it. There is no conversion to insert — a slot cannot hold "call this on read" — so
`gateObjectLiteral` refuses it as a not-yet (`STA1214`, Phase 5) rather than emitting a program that
reads garbage. This refusal did not exist before, because before this change the literal itself was
the not-yet.

**Semantics pinned against Node, not against the spec text.** `runtime/tests/print_accessors.{c,mjs}`
and `tests/golden/{ts/object_accessors.ts,js/object_accessors.js}` compare byte-for-byte:
`util.inspect` does NOT call the getter (`[Getter]`, `[Setter]`, `[Getter/Setter]`); `Object.keys`
does not either, while `Object.values`, `Object.entries` and `JSON.stringify` do; a write to a
get-only property throws `TypeError: Cannot set property x of #<Object> which has only a getter`.
That last one needed an ESM probe to measure: `node -e 'o.x = 5'` is **sloppy mode**, where the
write silently does nothing. Compiled modules are always strict, so the sloppy answer would have
been the wrong ground truth.

**Found in passing, NOT fixed (pre-existing, unrelated to accessors).** A closure created at MODULE
scope that captures a loop-body binding reads one shared global slot instead of a per-iteration
one:

```
const fns = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) { const captured = i * 10; fns.push(() => captured); }
fns.forEach(f => console.log(f()));      stator: 20 20 20      node: 0 10 20
```

The same code inside a function is correct (`0 10 20`) — the per-iteration env clone
(`jsrt_env_clone` / `jsrt_env_copy_slots`) is emitted there and not at module scope, where bindings
are global slots that never get an environment. No golden fixture covered it. It is a real Node
divergence and wants its own task; the accessor fixtures put their capture case inside a function
so they test accessors rather than this.

**Where in plan.md.** Step 12(c)'s record moves to `done.md`; step 12 keeps (d)–(f).

## 193. Three closure/value-position bugs behind one module-scope repro (2026-09-04)

Entry 192 closed with a divergence found in passing and left unfixed: a closure created at MODULE
scope capturing a loop-body binding read one shared slot (`20 20 20` where Node prints `0 10 20`).
Reproducing it surfaced two more defects stacked in front of it, each independent of the others and
each a bug on its own. All three are fixed here; all three now have golden fixtures.

**1. A console call had no value (STA0009, generated C did not compile).** Every `console.*` entry
point returns `void` in C, and the emitter returned that call text as an expression. In statement
position that is fine; in VALUE position clang got `JSRT_LOCAL(0) = jsrt_print(...)` and refused the
file. The verifier had always pinned the node's HIR type to `undefined`, so the emitter was
contradicting a type the HIR already stated. `const r = console.log(x)`, and any arrow whose
expression body is a console call, hit it — which is why the original capture repro
(`fns.forEach(f => console.log(f()))`) could not even be built.

The fix is the `void` unary operator's own shape, `(expr, JSRT_UNDEFINED)`, and it is applied ONLY
in value position: `(jsrt_print(x), JSRT_UNDEFINED);` as a statement is a `-Wunused-value` warning
on every `console.log` in the program (measured, not assumed). Both positions now route through one
`consoleCall` helper so the width-to-entry-point rule is stated once.

**2. A `for-of` binding had two types (STA4010, internal error).** The lowering typed the loop
variable from the checker at the binding name; the verifier typed it from the lowered iterable.
They agree for everything annotated, and disagree exactly where js mode has widened something the
checker still resolves: `const xs = []; xs.push(1)` is an evolving array — `number[]` to the
checker, `Unknown` to the widening — so the binding claimed `number` while the emitted loop yielded
a tagged value. `forOfElementType` moved from `verify.ts` to `hir/nodes.ts` and both callers now ask
it, which is what stops the two answers diverging again rather than just re-aligning them today.

**3. The module-scope capture itself.** Root cause is one line of `lower/captures.ts` pass 1 and the
assumption written above it: *"a module-level binding lives in the globals array, which every
function can already reach, so it is never a capture."* True for the life of the program — and
false for a `let`/`const` declared inside a top-level loop, which JavaScript re-creates every
iteration. One global slot cannot hold three bindings.

The fix does not add a mechanism; it gives an existing one its missing owner. The MODULE now owns an
environment (`EnvOwner = FunctionLike | ts.SourceFile`) holding exactly those per-iteration
bindings, laid out by the same rule a function's `envVars` follow. Everything downstream was already
built: `loopNeedsPerIterationEnv` had been firing at module scope all along and `enterLoop` was
discarding it for want of an environment (`envMap.size > 0`); the clone/commit pair now runs there
unchanged. `var` is deliberately excluded — function-scoped sharing IS its semantics, and the
globals array already implements it.

Two seams this touched, both narrow. `JSRT_GLOBALS_ENV` roots the module env through the globals
frame, which is the only frame a sync `main` has; the emitter picks between it and `JSRT_FRAME_ENV`
by scope. And the async-module path takes the same layout an async FUNCTION already uses — captured
bindings at env indices `0..envVars.length-1`, suspension-surviving locals numbered past them — so
top-level `await` needed no separate case.

**What was measured, not assumed.** Node is the ground truth for all four semantics the fixtures
pin: the loop variable is per-iteration too (`for (let i)` closures print `0 1 2`); a write after
the closure is built is visible through it, so the closure holds the BINDING and not a snapshot;
`var` in the same shape correctly prints `3 3 3`; and nested top-level loops each contribute their
own binding. The ts-mode twin asserts the value positions COMPILE — TypeScript types `console.log`
as `void` and refuses it as an argument, so what it prints is `typeof`, not the value.

**Where in plan.md.** New §8 **step 13**, landed; the record is in `done.md`. It is not step 12
residue: nothing here was a deferred surface with a `notYet` site. These are three defects in
shipped constructs, which is why they are a step of their own rather than a family of 12.

## 194. Step 2a(b): the remaining `STA0012` buckets, judged one at a time (2026-09-04)

**What the step asked.** Plan §8 step 2a(b) leaves "the rest of the `STA0012` buckets, each judged
individually against §1.2 rather than as a group — some are real refusals Stator should keep." This
entry records the judgment for every bucket above ~70 Test262 tests, what landed, and what did not
and why. The buckets come from the failure corpus in `tests/test262/results.json`; the message text
was mapped back to TypeScript diagnostic codes through the compiler's own `ts.Diagnostics` table,
because the runner records the rendered message and not the code.

**The criterion, unchanged.** `JS_MODE_RUNTIME_CODES` drops a checker refusal when *the dynamic
runtime settles it and the answer is a value*. That is a narrower promise than "untyped code is
never rejected", and the difference is what did most of the sorting here.

**Landed — four codes, each with a both-modes fixture and a golden proving js mode matches Node.**

| Code | Bucket | Why it is not a refusal |
|---|---|---|
| 18050 | 194 tests — `The value 'undefined' cannot be used here` | `1 + undefined` is NaN. This is the coercion table with one operand spelled as the keyword, and 2362/2363 (the same table, two operands) were already dropped for the same reason (notes 177). Test262 asserts exactly these in `language/expressions/addition/S11.6.1_A3.1_*`. |
| 2403 | 85 tests — `Subsequent variable declarations must have the same type` | `var x = 1; var x = 'a'` is ONE binding assigned twice. TypeScript refuses it only because it wants one type per name. |
| 2695 | 130 tests — `Left side of comma operator is unused` | A style lint. The operator's answer is its right operand either way. |
| 8024 / 8029 | 81 tests — `JSDoc '@param' tag has name 'X', but there is no parameter with that name` | A COMMENT cannot refuse a program. The parameter list is the code; the tag is metadata. |

**2403 needed a fix, not just a suppression, and that is the useful finding.** Dropping the code
alone turned the refusal into `STA4004 internal error in assignment: assignment target type number
does not match value type string` — an internal error is always a compiler bug, so the suppression
would have traded a wrong refusal for a worse one. The mechanism it needed already existed:
`runtimeDynamicSymbols`, added for 2322 in commit 30f7ae8, marks the binding dynamic through
lowering. 2403 is the same disagreement spelled as a redeclaration rather than as an assignment, so
it joins the same branch — a two-line change, no new mechanism. **Rule this generalizes:** a
suppression is only finished when the program it admits COMPILES; a code that turns `STA0012` into
`STA4xxx` is not a candidate, it is a bug report.

**Judged as real refusals — kept in both modes.** The strict-mode family, ~383 tests together:
`'with' statements are not allowed in strict mode` (168), `Invalid use of 'X'. Modules are
automatically in strict mode` (134), `Identifier expected. 'X' is a reserved word in strict mode`
(81). §1.2 already settles these: Stator compiles ESM, ESM is always strict, and sloppy mode and
`with` are errors in BOTH modes by design. Nothing here is a value the runtime could settle — the
program has no sloppy-mode reading to run.

**Judged correct but not landable yet — blocked on a Stator not-yet, not on the judgment.** Three
codes are genuine §1.2 violations whose suppression cannot satisfy the step's Check, because the
Check demands a golden and the program still does not compile after the code is dropped. Measured,
one probe each:

| Code | Bucket | What the suppression exposes |
|---|---|---|
| 2683 | 576 lines — `'this' implicitly has type 'any'` | `STA1214 this outside a class member` — step 12(d)/(e) surface. |
| 2769 | 206 tests — `No overload matches this call` | the probe (`new Date({})`, Test262's own shape) needs the `Number` global and method calls, both not-yet. |
| 2464 | 86 tests — `A computed property name must be of type ...` | `STA1214 an object literal key that is not an identifier` — step 12(c) residue, named there already. |

These are queued behind their real blockers rather than landed blind: an untested suppression pins
nothing about what happens when the blocker lifts. **When 2683 is taken, take it as an OPTION and
not as a code** — `noImplicitThis: mode === 'ts'`, alongside the `noImplicitAny` / `noImplicitOverride`
/ `useUnknownInCatchVariables` opt-outs already in `createProgram`. `this` with no annotation is
untyped code, which is what that group of options is for; the code list is for refusals of code that
IS typed.

**One shared blocker behind the largest bucket, and it is worth naming.** `Cannot find name 'X'`
(2304/2552) is 1345 lines, the biggest remaining bucket, and it is NOT a refusal Stator should keep:
an unresolvable name is valid JavaScript whose answer is a runtime `ReferenceError`. Two things stop
it, both measured. First, `gateIdentifier` reaches its `decl === undefined` arm and returns `accept`
for a symbol-less identifier, so a bare suppression produces `STA4035`/`STA4002` downstream — the
same "suppression must not manufacture an internal error" rule 2403 just demonstrated. Second, and
the real cost: **the runtime has no Error object model at all.** `runtime/src/jsrt_throw.c` throws
values, `jsrt_throw_str` throws a *string*, and every TypeError in the runtime is a string literal
prefix (`jsrt_throw_str("TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property")`). There is no `Error`
constructor, no `.name`, no `e instanceof ReferenceError` — so no golden can prove js mode reaches
Node's answer, because the answer is an object the runtime cannot build.

That same blocker covers three more buckets, which is why it is recorded here rather than in one
bucket's row: 2488 `must have a '[Symbol.iterator]()' method` (113), 2540/2704 read-only assign and
delete (272 together), 2454 `used before being assigned` (92, TDZ). **The split that sorts all of
them: a code whose runtime answer is a VALUE can be dropped today; a code whose runtime answer is a
thrown Error is blocked on the error-object model.** Roughly 1800 Test262 lines sit behind that one
piece of runtime surface — a larger prize than any remaining bucket, and it should be scoped as its
own step rather than smuggled into step 2a.

**On the numbers.** Step 2a's Check anticipates this exactly: "a harness file can carry several
independent checker diagnostics, so removing an earlier one may only expose the next `STA0012`."
Three of the four landed codes are of that shape — `var_redeclare`, `comma_operator` and
`jsdoc_param` appear in Test262 files that carry other diagnostics too. The per-code evidence above
(a probe per code, compiled and diffed against Node) is therefore the honest measurement, and the
aggregate ratchet is reported as whatever the full run says rather than claimed in advance
(notes 182).

## 195. The Error object model: no new mechanism, one wrong answer removed (2026-09-05)

**Why this and not another bucket.** Step 2a(b)'s sweep (notes 194) ended by naming one blocker
behind roughly 1800 Test262 lines: four `STA0012` buckets whose runtime answer is a *thrown Error
object* rather than a value, and a runtime that could not build one. `jsrt_throw_str` threw a
STRING, and every TypeError in the runtime was a string-literal prefix — `jsrt_throw_str("TypeError:
Cannot assign to read only property")`. A `catch` block could read neither `.name` nor `.message`.

**The finding that made it cheap: an Error needs no representation of its own.** `JSRTClass` already
carries a `name`, a field list, and a `parent`, and `jsrt_instanceof` already walks that parent chain
— the header says it outright, that the chain "IS the prototype chain as far as this subset can
observe it: the only question anything asks of it is `instanceof`". So the five standard classes are
five file-scope `const JSRTClass` values in `runtime/src/jsrt_error.c` whose `parent` is `Error`,
exactly the way `jsrt_class_map` and `jsrt_class_set` already sit in `jsrt_map.c`. `name` and
`message` are SLOTS, which means `e.message` is the ordinary fixed-shape read every other object
gets and `fixed_get` needed no special case at all. **Nothing in jsrt_shape.c changed.** The whole
model is one new file, five descriptors, and two functions.

**A wrong answer, not a missing feature.** `Error` was already in the gate's `INSTANCEOF_BUILTINS`,
so `e instanceof Error` COMPILED — and `jsrt_instanceof_builtin` returned false for it, with a
header comment saying `Error` "has no representation yet and answers false". That is not a gap, it
is a silently incorrect result at exactly the point where a catch block decides what to do with a
failure. It is now the descriptor walk, and the boxed `Boolean`/`Number`/`String` names left in that
comment are flagged as the same hazard rather than as an absence.

**Node's wording, which is half the value.** The frozen-write TypeError said "Cannot assign to read
only property" and stopped there. Node says `Cannot assign to read only property 'a' of object
'#<Object>'`, and both of Stator's frozen-write paths now do too — the dynamic one in `store_prop`
has the key in hand, and the fixed-shape one in `jsrt_object_set` reads it from
`cls->fields[slot]`. A TypeError that does not say WHICH property is the least useful half of the
message.

**What it unblocked in the same change.** TS2540 (`Cannot assign to 'X' because it is a read-only
property`) and TS2704 (its `delete` sibling) — 272 Test262 lines — moved into
`JS_MODE_RUNTIME_CODES` immediately, because their runtime answer is now an object the runtime can
build. That is the loop closing: notes 194 refused to suppress them precisely because it could not,
and named the reason.

**`new TypeError('x')` in user code.** The remaining half. It is NOT a `NewExpr`: there is no class
declaration to take a descriptor from, because the descriptor is the runtime's. So it is one node
(`error-new`) threaded the way `date-new` already is — one operand, one rooted slot, one runtime
call — differing in a single respect, that it names a descriptor as well as its operand. The class
comes from the CALLEE and not from the checker's type, deliberately: TypeScript types all five as
the structural `Error` interface, so the type would lose which one was written, and which one was
written is exactly what `instanceof` has to answer.

**What the verifier pins, and why it is the layout rather than the kind.** `jsrt_error_new` writes
slot 0 and slot 1 BY INDEX, and every downstream `e.message` resolves against the same two fields.
A type that disagreed with `jsrt_error.c` would therefore be a wrong SLOT, not a wrong answer.
STA4095 compares the node's type against `errorHType(ctor)`, which checks the class name, the field
order and the base chain in one place — the only place the emitter's and the runtime's definitions
can drift.

**Three divergences from Node, recorded rather than hidden.**
1. `name` and `message` are enumerable here and non-enumerable in Node, so `Object.keys(new
   Error('x'))` is `['name', 'message']` where Node answers `[]`. Non-enumerability is a
   property-descriptor feature the subset does not have at all (`Object.defineProperty` is a Phase 8
   not-yet), so this is an existing gap showing through a new hole, not a new gap.
2. `console.log(err)` prints the object; Node prints a stack trace. Inherent — this runtime has no
   stack to print, which `jsrt_uncaught` already documents as a deliberate deviation.
3. The `jsrt_panic` sites (`null.x`, a non-function callee, a primitive write) still ABORT where
   Node throws a catchable TypeError. Converting a panic to a throw changes control flow at every
   caller, which is its own change; this one converted the sites that already threw.

**What still sits behind this, now for a different reason.** 2304/2552 `Cannot find name` (1345
lines, still the largest bucket) no longer needs a runtime it does not have — it needs the GATE
path: `gateIdentifier` returns `accept` for a symbol-less identifier, so a bare suppression
manufactures `STA4035`/`STA4002` rather than a `ReferenceError`, which is the same rule TS2403
demonstrated in notes 194. 2488 (`Symbol.iterator`) and 2454 (TDZ) need their throw sites converted
from panics, per divergence 3 above.

## 196. Measuring step 2a on a 655-test slice: what the suppressions actually did (2026-09-05)

Notes 194/195 judged the buckets and landed six codes; this is the measurement of the result, taken
without restarting the full Test262 run. `tests/test262/run.ts` has no filter flag, so the slice was
taken the way the runner already supports — `STATOR_TEST262` pointed at a scratch root holding a
symlinked `harness/` and copies of the four directories the landed codes touch:
`built-ins/Object/freeze`, `language/expressions/{addition,assignment,delete}`, 655 tests.

```
TOTAL 655: passed 41, failed 115, skipped 499
  test/built-ins/Object/freeze          p   0 f   0 s  53
  test/language/expressions/addition    p   0 f  15 s  33
  test/language/expressions/assignment  p  39 f  66 s 380
  test/language/expressions/delete      p   2 f  34 s  33
FAIL REASONS:  115  STA0012
```

**The result worth keeping is the one in the FAIL column: 115 failures, every one of them
`STA0012`, and not a single `STA4xxx`.** That is the direct check on notes 194's rule — a
suppression is finished only when the program it admits COMPILES, and a code that turns `STA0012`
into an internal error is a bug report rather than a candidate. TS2403 broke that rule and was
caught by one fixture; this is the same question asked of 655 programs at once, and the answer is
clean. The ratchet line the slice prints (`passed dropped from 2379 to 41`) is slice-versus-corpus
arithmetic, not a regression — `ratchet.json` is a whole-corpus gate and was neither consulted nor
moved here. `results.json` was backed up and restored, since the runner writes it unconditionally.

**A correction this measurement forced, to notes 195 and to §8 step 2a(c).** Those recorded 2540 and
2704 as landing together, "the loop closing". Only half of that is true, and the halves differ in
kind:

- **2540** (read-only *assignment*) genuinely landed: the program compiles and the runtime answers
  with a real `TypeError` carrying Node's wording, which is what `tests/golden/js/error_objects.js`
  proves.
- **2704** (read-only *delete*) only RECLASSIFIES. The `delete` operator is not lowered at all —
  there is no `DeleteExpression` case in `src/lower/index.ts` or `src/frontend/gate.ts`, and no
  `jsrt_delete` in the runtime — so dropping the checker's refusal moves the program from `STA0012`
  to `STA1214 (DeleteExpression) ... planned for Phase 5`:

  ```
  $ node src/cli/main.ts build del2.js --mode=js    # const o = Object.freeze({a:1}); delete o.a;
  del2.js:2:1 STA1214 [js] this construct (DeleteExpression) is not yet supported; planned for Phase 5
  ```

  That is a legitimate landing under §1.3 — it is the same "checker lint → Stator's own schedule"
  attribution the earlier five made, and the not-yet code names the phase that owns the blocker
  rather than an internal error. It is NOT a claim that `delete` works, and step 2a(c) has been
  edited to stop implying it. The operator itself is step-12 residue.

**A bucket the sweep missed, found here.** `delete` on a *required* property is **TS2790**
(`The operand of a 'delete' operator must be optional`, 7 tests in the slice), which is a different
code from the 2704 notes 194 judged and was never on the list. It is a §1.2 violation of the same
family — in JavaScript `delete o.a` is legal and answers a boolean — and it is blocked on the same
thing: the operator has no lowering, and a fixed-shape object losing a field is a shape question the
runtime has not been asked yet. Recorded as an open bucket in §8 step 2a(c) rather than left
invisible.

**What the residue confirms about the rest of notes 194's judgment.** Grouping the 115 failures by
checker sentence reproduces the sweep's conclusions on independent evidence: ~38 are the strict-mode
family (`'X' cannot be called on an identifier in strict mode`, reserved words, `Modules are
automatically in strict mode`) — the **real refusal Stator keeps**, because §1.2 makes ESM strict in
both modes and there is no sloppy reading to run; 20 are 2488 `Symbol.iterator`; 6 are 2304/2552
`Cannot find name`; 2 are 2454 TDZ. All four were already named as open in step 2a(c) with the
blockers they still have, so the slice adds no new work beyond 2790 — which is the useful shape for
a measurement to have.

## 198. Test262 on every commit costs 2–3.5 hours, so the job is sharded (2026-09-05)

**The contradiction.** `ci.yml`'s Test262 job carried `timeout-minutes: 120` and a comment saying
the ceiling existed so a long job would not "look hung". The ceiling was below what the job costs,
so for three consecutive pushes CI was red for a reason that was not a conformance result:

| run | outcome |
|---|---|
| 33698313848 | green in **1h42m31s** |
| 33648633200 | green in **3h26m12s** |
| 33791545034 / 33814794456 / 33848166181 | killed at **2h00m21s / 2h00m18s / 2h00m22s** |

The three kills are the ceiling, not a test: they land within four seconds of 120 minutes, the log
ends mid-run with `Terminate orphan process: pid (…) (node-MainThread)`, and no `test262:` summary
line is ever written. A run that cannot report its number is the failure mode §9's opening paragraph
exists to prevent, and it had been the state of `main` for days.

**Why it costs that.** Measured, not estimated. `built-ins/Math` is 327 files of which 276 reach a
build (the rest stop at the feature check); the run burns 298 CPU-seconds, so **~1.0 CPU-second per
spawned test** — dominated by `node src/cli/main.ts` booting the `typescript` package once per test.
Across the pinned corpus, `passed + failed + STA12xx skips` is ~24,700 spawns, i.e. ~24,700
CPU-seconds. A 4-vCPU `ubuntu-24.04` runner at roughly half this host's per-core speed lands at
2–3.5 h, which is exactly the observed spread — the 1h42m and 3h26m completions are the same job on
a fast and a slow runner.

**The decision: shard, do not relocate.** Moving the corpus to `nightly.yml` was the smaller change
and was rejected: `ci.yml` says this job "makes the pinned conformance number visible on every
commit", and a nightly number stops answering "did THIS commit move conformance". Raising the
ceiling to 360 was also rejected — it makes every push wait 2–3.5 h for a green tick while fixing
nothing about the cost. Four shards put each near 50 minutes and keep the per-commit property.

**Round-robin, not contiguous.** `--shard=N/M` takes every Mth test from the sorted list. Cost per
test spans two orders of magnitude and clusters by directory (`built-ins/Temporal` stops at a
feature check; `language/expressions` compiles), so contiguous slices would finish hours apart and
the job would still be paced by its worst shard. Round-robin measured 46/46/45/45 tests on a
182-file slice with per-verdict counts within three of each other.

**A shard gates nothing.** Both gates are statements about the corpus — the ratchet compares totals,
`expected-fail.txt` names individual tests — and neither is decidable from a quarter of it. So a
shard writes `results-N-of-M.json` and reports its slice; a separate `test262-report` job runs
`--aggregate`, which reassembles the shards and applies the gates once. The reporting and gating
code is shared verbatim by both paths rather than copied, so "conformance" has one definition.

**Proof of equivalence.** On a 182-file slice, four shards plus `--aggregate` reproduce the
unsharded run's stdout **byte-for-byte** (32 passed, 129 skipped, 21 unexplained failures), and both
exit 1 on the same ratchet failure. stderr differs only in the `test-<pid>-<slot>.js` scratch names,
which are per-process by construction.

**Two ways a sharded run could lie, both closed.** A shard that dies uploads no artifact, and
merging the survivors would publish a smaller corpus as if it were the whole one — fewer failures
reads as a conformance win and sails past the ratchet; `--aggregate` therefore reads the divisor out
of the file names and refuses a set that is not complete (`expected 4 shards …, found 3`). A shard
run twice with the wrong `--shard=N/M` would merge its tests in twice and inflate the totals the
same way; duplicate paths are refused too.

**Latent, deliberately left alone.** The Test262 job still never builds `libjsrt.a` — no `just
runtime` step, and `actions/cache` covers only the corpus — so anything reaching the link step gets
`STA0011`. Measured with and without the archive on `language/types`, the verdicts are *identical*
(11 passed, 82 skipped, 20 failed): nothing currently gets far enough for the archive to matter, and
every pass is a negative-parse test that never links. Adding the archive would change the published
number and must be its own change against a re-recorded ratchet, not a rider on a timeout fix.

## 197. `Cannot find name`: the largest bucket, and the internal error it was hiding (2026-09-05)

Step 2a(c)'s first clause. TS2304/TS2552 (1345 Test262 lines, the largest bucket the sweep left)
are now dropped in js mode, and reading a name nothing declares answers the way JavaScript does:
`ReferenceError: <name> is not defined`, catchable, with a working `instanceof`. This is the bucket
notes 194 said needed no runtime it did not have — only somewhere for the answer to come from, which
notes 195 built.

**The mechanism is one HIR node and one runtime function.** `ReferenceErrorRead` carries a NAME
rather than a binding, because having no binding is the condition being modelled; `jsrt_reference_error`
formats Node's message, throws through `jsrt_throw_error`, and returns `JSRT_UNDEFINED` purely so the
emitter has a C value for an expression position. The emitter follows it with the same
`jsrt_pending()` check every throwing call gets, and because the case appends LINES, `sequencePart`
flushes the operands already evaluated out as a statement first — which is what keeps the language's
evaluation order across a throw that happens mid-expression.

**The gate needed no change, and that is the interesting part.** `gateIdentifier`'s global branch is
guarded by `symbol !== undefined`, so a symbol-less identifier was already falling through to
`accept`. What plan §8 step 2a(c) recorded as "needs the gate path" was half right: the gate accepts
it, and it was the LOWERING that manufactured `STA4035`. The fix is one branch there, and the test
it turns on is `checker.getSymbolAtLocation(node) === undefined` — which is what separates a name the
checker could not resolve (a ReferenceError the program may catch) from a name the checker DID
resolve arriving with no binding (a compiler bug the gate should have refused). Collapsing those two
would make the new node swallow compiler bugs silently.

**`typeof` is answered on the operator, not the operand.** §13.5.1.1 short-circuits before the
reference is resolved, which is why `typeof x === 'undefined'` is the idiom for asking whether a
global exists at all. The lowering answers with a `'undefined'` string literal in the TypeOf branch;
teaching the identifier branch about its parent would have put the exception in the wrong place.

**The regression the landing caused, and the rule that caught it.** Suppressing 2304 turned three
WRITE forms into `STA4034 identifier 'x' assigned before declaration` — an internal error, for a
program the language has a perfectly good answer for. That is exactly notes 194's rule (a suppression
is finished only when the program it admits COMPILES), and it was caught by asking it of 24 syntactic
positions at once rather than of one fixture:

```
$ node probe_ref.mjs        # before
STA4034   assignment target
STA4034   compound assign
STA4xxx internal errors: 2
$ node probe_ref.mjs        # after
STA4xxx internal errors: 0
```

The fix models the ordering the language actually specifies, because the difference is observable:
a simple `=` evaluates its right side FIRST and throws after (`missing = side()` runs `side`), while
a compound assignment or an update reads the target before the right side runs and throws
immediately. The first lowers to a `flatten` Block — the right side as a statement, then the throw —
and the second to the throw alone. `tests/golden/js/reference_error_write.js` pins both against
Node, and it is the ordering, not the message, that the fixture exists for.

**A pre-existing bug this uncovered but did NOT cause, and did not fix.** `missing.a = 1` and
`missing[0] = 1` still raise `STA4035`. They are not in this bucket: TypeScript AUTO-DECLARES a
global from a property assignment in a `.js` file, so the checker reports **nothing** for them and
they were reaching the lowering with a symbol long before 2304 was suppressed:

```
missing.a = 1;         diags=[]      HAS SYMBOL     <- no TS2304; pre-existing STA4035
missing = 1;           diags=[2304]  no symbol      <- this landing
```

The symbol test above is precisely why they do not accidentally get swept in — but they are a real
internal error for legal JavaScript, whose answer is the same ReferenceError, and fixing them means
telling a TS-synthesized JS global apart from a real binding. Left open deliberately rather than
folded into this change.

**Still open under step 2a(c) after this:** 2488 `Symbol.iterator` and 2454 TDZ (panic-to-throw), and
the two delete buckets 2704/2790 (the `delete` operator has no lowering at all — notes 196).

## 199. Inferred JS namespaces do not declare runtime bindings (2026-09-05)

Fixes the `missing.a = 1` / `missing[0] = 1` internal-error residue explicitly left open by
note 197 and plan §8 step 2a(c). On pinned TypeScript 6.0.3, both programs have no checker
diagnostics but lower to `STA4035`. Their symbols have `SymbolFlags.Assignment` and only bare
`Identifier` declarations: TypeScript inferred an expando namespace, not a runtime declaration.

**The distinction is declarations, not just flags.** `const real = { a: 0 }; real.a = 1` has
the same Assignment flag, but its symbol merges a `VariableDeclaration` with the expando
identifier. Real bindings must remain real, and a missing lowered slot for a real declaration
must still report the internal error rather than silently becoming a runtime throw.

One shared `isUnresolvableIdentifier` predicate in `src/lower/index.ts` recognizes an absent
binding whose symbol is either missing or an Assignment symbol with a nonempty, all-Identifier
declaration list. Reads, `typeof`, and bare writes use it. `typeAt` must use it too: the inferred
namespace shape is not an object layout the program ever produces, and a property consumer must
agree with `ReferenceErrorRead`'s Unknown type instead of asking for a fixed field slot.
No mode check, new HIR node, runtime change, dependency, or checker suppression is needed.

**Proof before/after:** the two new regression tests failed before the implementation
(`lowerSourceFile should produce a module`); the focused suite now passes **14/14**.
`tests/golden/js/reference_error_property.js` compiles and its native stdout is byte-identical
to Node v26.7.0 (`diff -u` exits 0). It catches both property-write forms, proves that neither
the key nor RHS runs after a missing receiver, and distinguishes bare assignment (RHS runs)
from compound assignment/update (RHS does not run). It also covers `typeof`, `finally`, and real
and shadowing declarations. Both-mode decision fixtures keep ts mode at `STA0012` and js mode
dynamic. Unit tests bypass the gate deliberately to verify that real declarations and unsupported
globals still retain `STA4035` when no lowered binding exists.

The Test262 corpus was not rerun or rebaselined; no aggregate conformance improvement is claimed.
The panic-to-throw and delete work remain open under step 2a(c).

**Full Check:** `pnpm run ci` exits 0 under Node v26.7.0: **382/382 unit tests**, subset **356
fixtures — 327 passed, 29 expected-fail, 0 failed**, golden **161/161**, the same **161/161 under
ASan/UBSan**, runtime print corpora matching Node in both builds, and the 10M-object leak loop
plateauing at **3040 KB**. Typecheck, lint, duplication gate and builtins dashboard passed too.
The completion record moved to `done.md`, leaving the specific bug's struck-through stub in
`plan.md`; the rest of step 2a(c) remains live.

## 200. Catchable property/iterator failures, not a fictitious TDZ conversion (2026-09-05)

Step 2a(c)'s panic-to-throw premise mixed three mechanisms. A JS function annotated
`@returns {Generator<number, void, unknown>}` but returning `1` built successfully and SIGSEGVed
when used in `for-of`; Node caught a `TypeError`. Iterator step/next and generator return/throw
now validate their descriptor before casting and leave a catchable TypeError in the pending cell.
Impossible internal iterator kinds remain compiler panics. This does **not** implement dynamic
GetIterator or justify suppressing checker diagnostic 2488.

Nullish property gets/sets and primitive writes likewise raise TypeError instead of aborting.
Dynamic property/index reads root their receiver/result and check pending immediately, as do
dynamic indexed writes and read-modify-write reads (before evaluating the RHS). Object static
calls now check pending too. Enumeration stops on a throwing getter and roots its partially
built output across callbacks. `Object.assign` snapshots **keys**, then alternates each get/set:
the old eager `collect(OBJ_ENTRIES)` ran later getters before earlier writes, losing partial
assignment and running getters even after a setter should have thrown.

The consumer audit found two additional paths through `jsrt_object_entries`: `JSON.stringify`
and `console.table`. Both now propagate errors and free their partial output/scratch storage;
their generated callers check pending in statement and expression positions. They snapshot keys
and process values one at a time so a nested serialization/row error prevents later getters,
instead of eagerly getting every property before the recursive operation has begun.

**The corrected premise:** TS2454 is definite assignment, not TDZ. An uninitialized annotated
binding holds `undefined`; syntactic TDZ is TS2448 and closure-mediated TDZ can evade both codes.
There is no runtime TDZ sentinel/check to convert. A trial suppressing 2454 and widening those
bindings exposed internal receiver checks for string/array/date/regexp methods (STA4081/4082/
4092/4086). The trial was removed. These buckets remain open until admitted programs compile
soundly, rather than trading checker diagnostics for internal errors. No suppression lands here.

Focused evidence: `node --test tests/unit/property-errors.test.ts` passes; `pnpm run test:runtime`
reports `runtime: print corpus matches Node`. The iterator corpus tests six incompatible receiver
tags across step/next/return/throw, and the accessor corpus checks abrupt enumeration and partial
assignment. `property_errors.js` and `iterator_receiver_error.js` match Node v26.7.0 byte-for-byte;
the former covers operand ordering, warm ICs, catch/finally, and Object.assign getter/setter stops.
No Test262 ratchet change.

**Full Check:** `pnpm run ci` exits 0 under Node v26.7.0: **383/383 unit tests**, dupes 0.9%,
subset **356 fixtures — 327 passed, 29 expected-fail, 0 failed**, golden **163/163** and the same
**163/163 under ASan/UBSan**, both runtime print corpora (now including `print_iterators`) matching
Node, builtins dashboard 217/238, and the 10M-object leak loop plateauing at **3040 KB**. The
"panic-to-throw" Check in `plan.md` §8 step 2a(c) is struck through pointing here; its record is in
`done.md` → Phase 5 step 2a(c). The 2488 and 2454 buckets and the delete Check stay live.

The final aggregate rerun including JSON/table caller cleanup and nested-getter regressions is
`/tmp/stator-phase5-errors-ci.log` (exit 0; 75 clones, 0.9% duplication; the same test counts above).

## 201. Nested worktrees are not parent source (2026-09-05)

An independent `.claude/worktrees/delete-op` checkout made even a focused Biome command fail with
`Found a nested root configuration`. Exclude `.claude/worktrees` from the parent Biome and CPD
scan roots; all production source rules and thresholds stay unchanged. The nested checkout and
its configuration are untouched. This is scan ownership, not a source lint exemption.

## 203. `repeat`/`padStart`/`padEnd` throw a catchable RangeError instead of aborting (2026-09-07)

`String.prototype.repeat` with a negative or infinite count, and any `repeat`/`padStart`/`padEnd`
whose result exceeds the string length cap (2^31−1), used to hit `jsrt_panic` (STA2005): a loud
process abort, because the panic predated the throw protocol. The Error model (note 195) and the
pending-cell protocol (note 200) both exist now, so these join it. `runtime/src/jsrt_string_ops.c`
calls `jsrt_throw_error(&jsrt_class_range_error, …)` at those four sites and returns `JSRT_UNDEFINED`;
the message matches Node byte-for-byte — `Invalid count value: <arg>` (the ORIGINAL argument, via
`jsrt_to_string`, not the truncated integer count) and `Invalid string length`.

A runtime throw is worthless unless the caller checks the pending cell, or the throw is silently
dropped — a bug worse than the abort. So `repeat`/`padStart`/`padEnd` were marked `throws: true` in
`STRING_OPS` (`src/hir/nodes.ts`), a `stringOpCanThrow` predicate joined `arrayOpCallsBack`'s pattern,
and the emitter's `canThrow` (`src/codegen/index.ts`) now emits each as a checked statement with a
pending check jumping to the landing pad. Two golden fixtures (`tests/golden/{js,ts}/string_range_error`)
catch each RangeError and print `e.name`/`e.message`, proving the throw is catchable in both modes and
identical to Node.

`STA2005`'s remaining string honesty clause is `normalize` with a bad form; `toUpperCase`/`toLowerCase`
above ASCII was already retired by libunicode (done.md, Task 4.3 third slice). DIAGNOSTICS.md STA2005
and SUBSET.md's `String.prototype` row updated to match. Check: `pnpm run ci` green.

## 204. Physical `packages/*` monorepo, orchestrated by moon (2026-09-07)

Owner-directed (2026-09-07): restructure the flat tree into a `packages/*` monorepo and add moon
(moonrepo) as the task orchestrator, both provisioned through mise. Two decisions were taken by the
owner up front: (a) a *physical* move — `src/` → `packages/compiler/`, `runtime/` →
`packages/runtime/`, all test harnesses → `packages/tests/` — not merely a logical grouping; and
(b) moon *wraps* the existing pnpm/just commands rather than replacing them, so `pnpm run ci` stays
the human/CI entry point and moon adds only a dependency graph + caching on top.

Layout. Root is a private pnpm workspace (`stator`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml` listing
`packages/compiler` and `packages/tests`; `packages/runtime` has no `package.json` — it is a C
project, not an npm package). `packages/compiler` is the published package (`statorc`, `bin.stator`
→ `dist/cli/main.js`) and holds `src/` + the locked `tsconfig.json`. `packages/tests`
(`@stator/tests`, private) holds every harness (unit/subset/golden/differential/bench/leak/test262)
plus a `tsconfig.json` extending the compiler's. All runtime deps became root devDependencies (the
compiler's own runtime deps are declared in `packages/compiler/package.json`).

Runtime path resolution. `packages/compiler/src/cli/build.ts` gained `resolveRuntimeRoot()`:
`STATOR_RUNTIME_ROOT` override → else sibling `packages/runtime` in dev → else `runtime/` beside a
published `dist/`. The runtime is located, never assumed relative to CWD.

moon. `.moon/{workspace,toolchain}.yml` + per-project `moon.yml`. moon 2.5 vocabulary: `vcs.client`
(not `manager`), project `layer` (not `type`), and layer relationship rules — `compiler` and
`runtime` are `library`, `tests` is `application` (an application may depend on libraries, not the
reverse). `moon run tests:ci` walks the whole graph with caching; `pnpm run ci` remains the serial
gate.

moon does NOT call `pnpm`. In this environment mise's `npm:@moonrepo/cli` provisions moon fine, but
mise's `npm:pnpm` install is a broken placeholder: `…/npm-pnpm/<v>/…/pnpm/pnpm` still contains the
"pnpm's native binary replaces this file during installation" stub, so any *raw* child process that
resolves `pnpm` on PATH and hands the file to node crashes with `SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected
token` (node tries to ESM-load the stub). The interactive shell works only because a compiled mise
shim / the lean-ctx wrapper re-execs it correctly; moon spawns raw and hits the stub. Fix: every
moon task is `toolchain: 'system'` and invokes the real tool directly — `just` (runtime),
`node …/run.ts` (harnesses), and the workspace-hoisted `./node_modules/.bin/{tsc,biome,cpd}` run
from the workspace root. This is a small, deliberate duplication of package.json's script bodies; the
moon.yml headers say package.json stays the source of truth. Compound scripts (coverage, asan) use
moon's `script:` field so `&&` and inline env work.

Fallout fixed: biome and jscpd ignore `.moon/cache` (moon caught its own cache JSON on the first
lint); `.github/workflows/{ci,nightly}.yml` artifact/cache paths gained the `packages/tests/`
prefix; the runtime justfile dropped its `cd runtime` now that moon/`-d` set the cwd. The
`.github/actions/setup` composite needs nothing — it reads `.node-version` and `packageManager` at
the root.

Check: `moon run tests:ci` exits 0 (subset 327 pass/29 expected-fail/0 failed, golden 165/165, leak
plateau, runtime-corpus matches Node, builtins 217/238), and `pnpm run ci` stays green.

**Environment note (2026-09-11).** moon loads its wasm plugin through wasmtime, whose module cache
defaults to the platform cache dir — `~/Library/Caches/BytecodeAlliance.wasmtime` on macOS, from
`ProjectDirs::from("", "BytecodeAlliance", "wasmtime")`. An agent harness that permits writes only
under the workspace therefore kills moon *before any task runs*:
`plugin::wasm::failed_container … failed to create cache directory … Operation not permitted`.
Nothing in the repo causes it and nothing in the repo can fix it, exactly like the mise-pnpm failure
above. wasmtime has no environment variable for this path — the only knob is its `config.toml`
(`crates/cache/src/config.rs`, `[cache] directory`, absolute) — so the fix is one machine-local file,
`~/Library/Application Support/BytecodeAlliance.wasmtime/config.toml`, pointing the cache somewhere a
restricted sandbox can still write:

    [cache]
    directory = "/tmp/BytecodeAlliance.wasmtime"

Verified on this host: `moon run compiler:lint` → `Tasks: 1 completed`, exit 0, modules cached under
`/tmp/BytecodeAlliance.wasmtime/modules`, and the old home cache dir is no longer created. Pointing it
at `.moon/cache/…` works too but is worse: the file is machine-wide, so other wasmtime users would
write their cache into this repository.

## 205. Task 6.2a landed: the Node-pin preflight (2026-09-08)

**Plan:** §9 Task 6.2a, opened by entry 191 finding 1. **What landed:** `scripts/check-node.mjs`
(dependency-free: `node:fs`/`node:path`/`node:url` only — it runs before anything is installed),
invoked first by `pnpm run ci` and by `ci.sh`; AGENTS.md's Commands preamble carries the
remediation. The guard compares the running Node MAJOR against `.node-version`'s major —
the Check names the major, so 26.x drift against the 26.7.0 pin still runs. Mismatch exits 1
with the cause plus `mise exec node -- <your command>`; match prints one confirmation line.

**Evidence (this host, whose PATH puts mise's `node/lts` v24.20.0 ahead of the shims):**
bare `node scripts/check-node.mjs` and `mise exec node@24 -- …` both exit 1 with the
remediation; `mise exec node@26.7.0 -- …` exits 0; bare `pnpm run ci` exits 1 before any
suite runs. Under the pin the full gate is green: typecheck (both projects), lint, dupes
(75 clones · 0.9%), runtime (Boehm), unit 383/383, coverage 90.46% exit 0, runtime corpus
match, subset 327/29/0, golden 165/165, builtins 217/238, leak plateau, `moon run tests:ci`
exit 0, ASan golden (`STATOR_RUNTIME=asan`) exit 0.

**Three deliberate scopings.** (a) No unit test: the test matrix is the runtime itself, so
the two-shell behavioral run above is the test — a test spawning "another Node" would need
a second binary the repo cannot assume. (b) `moon run tests:ci` does not invoke the guard:
moon's tasks spawn the ambient node directly (entry 204's no-pnpm rule), so a moon run from
an off-pin shell still trusts PATH. The Check names only `pnpm run ci`; the moon gap is
recorded here, not fixed here. (c) Drive-by: `ci.sh`'s trailing `just runtime-asan` stopped
resolving after the `packages/*` move (no root justfile since entry 204); now
`just -f packages/runtime/justfile -d packages/runtime runtime-asan`.

**Not a new dependency** (AGENTS.md budget rule): a ~50-line stdlib-only script is what "a
few lines couldn't do" needs no entry for — there is nothing to depend on. **plan.md
edited:** yes — Task 6.2a is a struck stub, its record in done.md → Phase 6.

## 206. Shared-code todo example, interface/type-alias landing, dashboard debt, docs paths (2026-09-08)

Four things, one session, each small enough to be its own commit. The request was "shared code in
examples + fix blockers"; the blockers turned out to be real and fourfold.

**1. `examples/todo/` — one shared core, both modes.** `shared.ts` is a typed task store
(interface + five pure functions, no I/O); `main-ts.ts` (ts mode) and `main-js.js` (js mode,
mixed graph importing the same `.ts` core) exercise it. Both binaries match the pinned Node
byte-for-byte (`diff` exits 0 both ways), and `stator explain` reports no errors. `README.md`
carries the exact build/run/ground-truth commands, verified verbatim from the root. `.gitignore`
gains the two demo binaries. Biome's `useTemplate` rule forced `${}` substitutions into the
example — which re-proved rung 2 rather than assumed it. The two entries are deliberately
different programs (different items, different flow) so the `js-ts` cross-format cpd gate stays
at 76 clones / 0.9%.

**2. Interfaces and type aliases land (SUBSET.md row 61).** Building the example exposed the gap:
docs promise "static", the gate answered `STA1214 (InterfaceDeclaration)`. The gate now accepts
both declarations (`src/frontend/gate.ts`), the lowering erases them — top-level skip plus a
nested no-op block, mirroring `EmptyStatement` (`src/lower/index.ts`). No HIR/verifier/codegen
change: uses of the name are annotations the checker already resolves. Two decision fixtures flip
out of expected-fail with HONESTLY DIFFERENT verdicts, and the difference is the point: `type`
aliases of object literals get fixed layouts (ts fixture: `static`), while a value TYPED by an
`interface` goes dynamic by deliberate design (`src/frontend/types.ts`: an interface may be
implemented by any class with any layout, so only anonymous shapes get layouts) — the js fixture
is now `@verdict: dynamic` with that reason in its comment, and it compiles where it used to be
rejected. `tests/golden/ts/interface_erase.ts` (incl. a nested interface-in-function) matches
Node byte-for-byte. `enum`/`namespace` stay refused: unlike these two, they have runtime meaning.

**3. Step-12 bookkeeping debt closed (all three sub-items, one bundle).** (a) `Promise.prototype`
claims `["ts/promise_then.ts", "js/promise_then.js"]`. (b) New js-column twin
`tests/golden/js/object_freeze.js` (class instance + dynamic object, catchable writes) matches
Node byte-for-byte; `freeze`/`isFrozen` cite both columns. Dashboard moves 217/238 → **222/238**,
`Promise.prototype: 3/3 (100%)`, `Object: 9/13` with only genuinely-missing members left.
(c) Red drift is now a build failure: `packages/tests/unit/builtins-coverage.test.ts`
cross-references every EMPTY claim against the `jsrt_*` symbols declared in
`packages/runtime/include/jsrt_value.h` (mechanical `jsrt_<ns>_<snake(member)>` mapping; console
aliases read from the same `CONSOLE_METHODS` table codegen emits through; `globals` skipped —
values, not entry points). Negative-proofed: emptying `then` fails with exactly
`claims [] but jsrt_promise_then is declared`. Per the debt note this lands as one bundle rather
than three commits; there is no step-12 family commit in flight to attach it to, so the bundle IS
the vehicle and this entry is the record. **plan.md edited:** the debt paragraph is now a struck
stub pointing at done.md → Phase 5.

**4. Monorepo-fallout docs paths.** README.md and docs/TOOLCHAIN.md still gave pre-move commands
(`node src/cli/main.ts`, bare `just runtime` — which fails with "no justfile found" at root).
Both now use `packages/` paths and the `-f/-d` just form (mirroring package.json scripts and
AGENTS.md); TOOLCHAIN's pin table corrected too (pnpm **12.3.4**, TS in
`packages/compiler/package.json`). Same sweep for prose refs in VALUE/NUMERIC/SUBSET/DIAGNOSTICS.
Two judgment calls: (i) `STA0011`'s remediation is EMITTED text, so the code changed with the doc —
`build.ts` now prints `just -f {runtime-root}/justfile -d {runtime-root} {recipe}` from the
resolved root (correct under `STATOR_RUNTIME_ROOT` too), verified by triggering it; no test pins
the old text. (ii) The `just runtime-intl` strings in STA1210/STA1215 messages stay: they name the
recipe, tests pin the codes, and `pnpm run test:intl` is the working one-hop path — renaming
emitted diagnostics is churn, not a fix.

**Full Check** (`mise exec node --`, pinned 26.7.0): tsc both projects clean; biome clean
(94 files); cpd 76 clones · 0.9%; unit **384/384**; subset **356 — 329 passed, 27 expected-fail,
0 failed**; golden **167/167** release and ASan; runtime print corpus matches Node both builds;
builtins 222/238 +5 carved; leak plateau 3040 KB; differential smoke 2 cases, 0 divergences;
coverage exit 0. The delete-operator branch (`delete-op` worktree) was inspected and left alone —
in-flight elsewhere, not this session's blocker.

## 207. Phase 6 was finished and the plan still described it as unstarted (2026-09-09)

**Contradiction.** `plan.md` §9 Task 6.2 step 1 read: *"Create `tests/differential/`. `AGENTS.md`'s
repo map already names it ("fuzzer corpus") and the directory does not exist — the map describes the
target state."* The directory has existed since **2026-09-02** (`c2e621b`, which also added
`tests/bench/programs/` and `.github/workflows/nightly.yml`) and was hardened on **2026-09-03**
(`78a5bf3`, "weight the fuzzer at its named regions, fix what that found (task 6.2)"). Notes 177,
178 and 179 write up that work in detail. `plan.md` carried both tasks as unstruck open records with
their full step lists for seven days, and `done.md` had no record of either — golden rule 1's "move
the record in the same change" did not happen for the commit that landed them.

**Measured at HEAD `4956428`, on the pinned Node 26.7.0:**

```
$ mise exec node -- node packages/tests/differential/run.ts --count=12
differential: seed=1 modes=ts,js
differential: 24 cases — 0 divergences                                    # 26 s

$ mise exec node -- node packages/tests/bench/record.ts
bench: recorded 5 programs to packages/tests/bench/results/…-darwin-arm64-….json
# generated page: stator 22.36 ms · node v26.7.0 59.29 ms · bun 1.3.14 20.00 ms · qjs/perry/scriptc/hermes absent
```

Every step of both tasks is implemented: xorshift-only entropy, type-directed generation, the five
weighted regions, the byte-for-byte pinned-Node oracle, delta-debugging minimizer, per-host result
files, discovery-based competitor matrix, the `ru_maxrss` kilobytes-on-Linux/bytes-on-macOS
normalization with the raw value kept beside it, and the weekly cron that writes the generated page
to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`.

**One residue, found by doing the measurement the step asks for.** Task 6.3 step 7 says to measure
the threshold before setting it. `record.ts` ships `thresholdPercent: 20` with nothing recorded
about where 20 came from. Recording the same commit twice on this host gives geomean
**22.358 → 21.458 ms — a 4.0% swing with no code change**. The gate is five times that, so it is
above the only noise anyone has measured; it is not yet above a *known* floor, which wants several
repeats on the machine that runs the weekly job. Left open in `plan.md` with its own Check rather
than quietly called done — this is the §9 failure mode (a green that proves less than it appears to)
applied to §9's own gate.

**What the phase Check still needs.** Clause 2 is *≥1 h nightly with zero unexplained divergences*.
The scheduled job exists and a local run is clean, but the clause passes on a nightly run's own
output, cited. So Phase 6's four tasks are archived and the phase stays open — the distinction
§15.2 exists to keep.

**Also noticed, not fixed.** §16's version log has two `v3.9` entries and two `v3.10` entries, dated
2026-09-04 and 2026-09-05, out of chronological order — the same collision class as notes 115 and
130, from parallel sessions appending at once. Nothing outside `plan.md` cites a log version, and
renumbering rewrites history other worktrees carry, so it is recorded here instead. The next log
entry took **v4.4**, which is unambiguous.

**Drive-by, found by running the harness at all: `bench:record` turned `pnpm run ci` red.**
`tests/bench/results/` is git-ignored but was not in `biome.json`'s `files.includes` exclusions, so
the two result files this verification produced failed `biome check --error-on-warnings` on JSON
formatting — 96 files checked, 2 errors, both mine. Every other generated-output directory is
already excluded there (`test262/results.json`, `test262/results-*-of-*.json`, `differential/`,
`golden/ts|js`); `results/` was the one that was missed, which is itself evidence that nobody had
recorded a benchmark and then linted on the same machine. One line added,
`"!packages/tests/bench/results"`. After it: biome 94 files clean, golden **167/167**, unit
**384/384**, `tsc --noEmit` clean on the tests project.


## 208. `docs/VALUE.md` §4.16 is wrong about method values: the receiver has to shift (2026-09-09)

**The contradiction.** §4.16 and `plan.md` §8 step 12(e) both record the method-value
representation as *settled* (2026-09-04, note 190): "A method value is the method's own
`JSRTClosure`, and `jsrt_arg` already answers `undefined` for the receiver a plain call does not
supply" — no allocation, no adapter, no new struct. Implementing step 12(e) against that section
is what showed it holds for a **zero-argument** call and for nothing else.

**Measured — the pinned Node 26.7.0**, `const g = o.add; g(1, 2)` on a two-parameter method:

```
this=obj a=1 b=2          // o.add(1, 2)
this=undefined a=1 b=2    // g(1, 2)
```

The receiver is dropped, and `a`/`b` keep their positions.

**Measured — this compiler**, `stator build meth.ts -o meth.c --emit=c` on the same class:

```c
static const JSRTClosure _jsrt_closure_0 = {_jsrt_fn_0, 3, "add", NULL};
...
JSRT_GLOBAL(2) = jsrt_call(jsrt_closure(&_jsrt_closure_0), 3, &JSRT_GLOBAL(2));
```

Parameter 0 is the receiver, so `a` is `argv[1]` and `b` is `argv[2]`, and the closure's arity is
**3** for a method the user wrote with two parameters. Two consequences the section does not have:

1. `jsrt_call(that closure, 2, [1, 2])` binds `this = 1`, `a = 2`, `b = undefined`. Every argument
   is off by one. The section's escape hatch — `jsrt_arg` answering `undefined` for an argument no
   call supplied — fills from the RIGHT, and the receiver is on the left.
2. `g.length` would answer 3 where Node answers 2, because `declaredArity` counts the receiver.

**Why a call site cannot fix it locally.** `g` is a `JSRTClosure` value like any other. Nothing in
that struct says "parameter 0 is a receiver", and a plain function's closure has no receiver
parameter at all — so `g(1, 2)` cannot decide whether to shift. The information has to travel WITH
the value, which is exactly the "new struct" §4.16 says is unnecessary. The cheapest shape that
works is a flag (or a receiver-arity byte) on `JSRTClosure` plus a shift in `jsrt_call`, with
`declaredArity` subtracting the receiver so `Function.length` stays right — not the two-slot
`JSRTEnv` thunk the section reserves for `Function.prototype.bind`, which is a different problem
(binding a receiver, rather than declining to).

**Not fixed here.** Step 12(e)'s receiver-free constructs landed (arbitrary callee, function
declarations in a block); its two receiver-carrying ones — **method values** and **calling a class
field** — stay `STA1214`, and the blocker they name is this note rather than "a bound closure
nothing here builds", which was never the obstacle. §15.4 reopening: the decision of 2026-09-04 is
edited, not deleted, because its conclusion is right for the zero-argument case it was reasoned on.

## 209. Block scoping is not modeled: a shadowed block binding shares the enclosing slot (2026-09-09)

Found while landing step 12(e)'s function-declaration-in-a-block, and **not a property of that
construct**: `let` and `const` have done it since blocks were first lowered.

**Measured**, `stator build shadow.ts -o shadow.c --emit=c` on

```ts
const x = 1;
{
  const x = 2;
  console.log(x);
}
console.log(x);
```

```c
JSRT_GLOBAL(0) = jsrt_number(1.0);
JSRT_GLOBAL(0) = jsrt_number(2.0);
jsrt_print(JSRT_GLOBAL(0));
jsrt_print(JSRT_GLOBAL(0));
```

Two bindings, one slot. The program prints `2` then `2`; the pinned Node prints `2` then `1`. No
diagnostic — a silent wrong answer, which is the failure mode the golden suite exists to catch and
which no fixture happened to cover.

**Root cause.** HIR names are SOURCE names. `Declaration.name`, `Assignment.target` and
`Identifier.name` are all the text the user wrote, and every consumer resolves by that text: the
lowering's `bindings` map, the verifier's scope map, and the emitter's `bindSlot`/`slotRef`. A
block that re-declares a visible name therefore reuses the one home that name has. `lowerBlock`
compounds it by mutating the caller's map in place rather than copying it, so the inner binding's
TYPE escapes the block too.

**The fix is alpha-renaming at the lowering**: a block-scoped declaration whose name is already
bound gets a fresh, unspellable HIR name, and references inside the block resolve to it. Done there
it is correct by construction for the verifier, the passes, the capture analysis and the emitter,
none of which would need to learn about scopes. It is not a small change — `bindings` is
`Map<string, HType>` threaded through ~34 sites in `src/lower/index.ts` and would become a scope
object carrying both the type and the HIR name — which is why it is a step of its own (§8 step 14)
rather than a rider on step 12(e).

**What landed instead.** Nested function declarations ship with a NARROW refusal covering exactly
the shadowing case (`gate.ts`, `shadowsEnclosingBinding`), so this landing adds no new silent
miscompile: `{ function outer() {} }` under an enclosing `outer` is `STA1214`, and every
non-shadowing spelling compiles. The `let`/`const` case older than this note stays unrefused —
gating it now would reject code the compiler has accepted since Phase 3, with the rename as the
only replacement — and step 14 owns removing both the defect and the refusal together.
## 210. `delete` lands by rebuilding the shape chain; a fixed shape refuses instead of shrinking (2026-09-09)

**What was open.** §8 step 2a(c) carried a Check with a question inside it: the two `delete` checker
buckets (2704 read-only delete, 2790 operand-must-be-optional) were to land "with the `delete`
OPERATOR — lowering plus whatever answer a fixed-shape object gives when it loses a field". 2704 had
already landed in the weak sense (plan-notes 196): dropping the checker's refusal only moved the
program from `STA0012` to `STA1214 (DeleteExpression)`, because no `DeleteExpression` existed
anywhere in `src/lower/`, `src/frontend/gate.ts` or the runtime. This note records the operator
itself and, more importantly, the answer to the question the Check left open.

**The answer: a fixed-shape object does not lose a field — it refuses.** `STA1108` (never) in ts
mode, `STA1205` (not-yet, Phase 8) in js mode, and `STA2007` at run time when an Unknown receiver
turns out to be fixed. That is the exact mirror of `STA2004` ("a statically-shaped object cannot
grow a new property; planned for Phase 8"), it lifts with the same Phase 8 dictionary-mode escape,
and it is the honest answer rather than a placement: a `JSRTClass` descriptor lists its fields at
compile-time offsets, and there is no encoding for a slot that is absent. Inventing one — a
per-field tombstone bit — would put a branch on every fixed-field read in the program to pay for a
construct ts mode does not admit at all.

**The refusal is nearly unreachable in ts mode, and that is a property of the type system, not luck.**
TS2790 requires the operand of a `delete` to be an OPTIONAL property; and an optional property is
precisely what `isDynamicShape`/`shapeTypeToHType` use to send an anonymous object type to the
dynamic representation. The two rules meet: every `delete` that type-checks in ts mode already has a
dynamic-shape receiver, so the only fixed shape `gateDelete` can still see is a class instance —
which §1.1 has always refused permanently. `STA1108`'s old note called that "delete on a class
field"; it is now recorded in `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md` as exhaustive rather than exemplary.

**Rejected alternative: a per-symbol deopt.** The other way to make a fixed-shape `delete` work is to
notice the `delete` during the frontend pass and demote just that symbol's literal to a dynamic
shape, through the existing `runtimeDynamicSymbols` channel. It works, but it means threading a
symbol set into `objectLiteralIsDynamic` at three call sites plus the gate plus the lowering, to buy
a construct that ts mode rejects outright and js mode will get for free from the Phase 8 dictionary
mode. Out of proportion; recorded here so the upgrade path is not re-derived.

**The removal mechanism: rebuild, not surgery.** `docs/VALUE.md` §4.10 had promised that "when
deletion lands it gets a dictionary-mode escape, not shape surgery". Neither happened, and the third
option is better than both. `jsrt_delete` replays the object's shape chain from the root, skipping
the deleted key and reusing the transitions that already exist. Shapes are shared immortal metadata,
so no node can lose a key in place; but replaying is O(keys) once and pays for itself three times
over. Insertion order survives, because the replay walks slots in order. Two objects that deleted the
same key from the same shape land on the SAME shape, so a shared read site's inline cache still hits
for both — shape sharing does the work a dictionary mode would have thrown away. And stale caches
need no invalidation at all: a `JSRTIC` is trusted by shape-POINTER compare, and the receiver now
points somewhere else, so a stale entry simply misses. Slot compaction happens in the same walk,
safely in place, because the write index never runs ahead of the read index.

**One fixed-shape delete does have a right answer, and it exposed the gap.** `Object.freeze({x: 1})`
builds a FIXED object, so the first frozen-delete fixture hit the `STA2007` abort instead of Node's
`TypeError: Cannot delete property 'x' of #<Object>`. The fix is not a representation: a frozen
property is non-configurable, so the spec's answer is to throw, and throwing needs no missing slot.
This is the same loop closing that bucket 2540 closed for read-only assignment (plan-notes 195) —
the refusal was never about `delete`, it was about the runtime not being able to build the answer.

**An array element is refused too**, statically at the gate and as an `STA2007` panic for an Unknown
receiver: a deleted element is a HOLE, and the dense array has no representation for one. That is the
same gap `gateArrayLiteral` names for `[1, , 3]` and `STA2002` for a sparse write, and it lifts with
Phase 5 rung 5, not Phase 8.

**Two extractions in `jsrt_shape.c`, made by the rebuild, not for it.** `shape_links` (the
offset-indexed fill of a shape's link array) came out of `jsrt_shape_property_order`, which now fills
then sorts; `shape_transition` (reuse-before-allocate) came out of `store_prop`. `jsrt_delete` calls
both. Duplication stayed at 0.9%.

**Test262, measured 2026-09-09 on the whole pinned corpus (53,580 tests, Node v26.7.0), recorded
under the plan-notes 182 rule.** Before (`ratchet.json`) → after:

```text
passed   2379 →  2372   (-7)
failed   7276 →  3100   (-4176)
skipped 43925 → 48108   (+4183)
pass rate 43.3%; new skip buckets include STA1205: 10
```

**The -4176 is this change, and it is the §1.3 attribution win the Check was for.** The cause is not
the operator but the 2790 suppression, applied to one harness file: `harness/propertyHelper.js` —
included by a large fraction of the corpus — does `delete obj[name]` at two sites. Every test that
included it therefore died at `STA0012`, an unattributed toolchain failure, before ever reaching
Stator's own schedule. Those tests now compile past the checker and land in `STA12xx`, where the
skip column can say what is actually missing. 1,233 corpus tests use a `delete` expression directly;
6 of them now pass, which is 6 more than could pass when `delete` had no lowering at all.

**The -7 is a REGRESSION and the ratchet correctly refuses it** (`FAIL ratchet: passed dropped from
2379 to 2372`). `ratchet.json` was NOT moved. It is not this change: before today every spelling of
`delete` produced either `STA1214` (no `DeleteExpression` case existed in the lowering) or `STA0012`
(2790), so no passing test could have contained one, and adding a code to `JS_MODE_RUNTIME_CODES`
only removes failures. The measurement was taken in a working copy a second session was landing
step 12(e) into, and plan-notes 209 records that landing as adding a deliberately over-broad
`STA1214` refusal for a block function declaration that shadows an enclosing binding — code that
compiled (wrongly) until today. Confirmed live: `{ function outer() {} }` under an enclosing `outer`
now answers `not-yet STA1214` in js mode, and 96 of the 159 tests in
`test/annexB/language/function-code/` — the B.3.3 block-declaration family — now skip with a bare
`STA1214`. **Attribution needs a re-measure in a tree with one owner**; until then the ratchet stays
where it is, because lowering it would bank someone else's regression as this task's baseline.

**Docs touched in the same change** (`AGENTS.md` golden rule 6 and the sole-allocator rule):
`docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md` allocates `STA2007` and `STA4097` (the verifier's "delete result must be
boolean"), narrows `STA1205`'s message and widens `STA1108`'s note; `docs/SUBSET.md` gains the
dynamic-shape `delete` row and re-words the two class-field rows; `docs/VALUE.md` §4.10 replaces the
sentence that is now wrong with the rebuild contract.
## 211. The human is the only author: no agent attribution on commits, merges or PRs (2026-09-11)

**Request.** Owner-directed rule, added as `AGENTS.md` golden rule 7 (so also `CLAUDE.md`, which is
a symlink to it): no agent adds a `Co-Authored-By` trailer, a "Generated with …" line or itself as
author to a commit, merge or PR — whatever its harness defaults to. Workflow step 6, where an agent
composes the commit, points at it.

**Why it has to be a written rule.** The default comes from the HARNESS, not from the repo: agent
runtimes append attribution unless told otherwise, and the history shows it — `1b98e92`, `6d9fc18`
and `17d5680` carry a `Co-Authored-By` trailer, the five most recent commits carry none. The file
every agent reads first is the one place that outranks a harness default for all of them at once.

**Scope.** Forward-looking: this change rewrites no history, so the older trailers remain.
`.claude/worktrees/delete-op/` is another branch's checkout with its own `AGENTS.md` copy and gets
the rule only when that branch is rebased (plan-notes 201: nested worktrees are not parent source).

## 212. Dependabot proposes npm and GitHub Actions bumps; the toolchain pins stay a recorded edit (2026-09-11)

**Request.** Owner-directed: add Dependabot. `.github/dependabot.yml` asks for weekly version
updates in two ecosystems. `npm` at `/`: Dependabot reads `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, so one entry
covers `packages/compiler` and `packages/tests`. `github-actions` at `/` plus `/.github/actions/*`:
`/` reads only `.github/workflows/` and a root `action.yml`, and the composite `setup` action is
where `pnpm/action-setup` and `actions/setup-node` live. CI runs on its PRs like on any other
(`pull_request`; no job needs a secret).

**The pin rule Dependabot can't keep.** `docs/TOOLCHAIN.md` moves a pin only in the commit that
updates its row, with the reason logged here, and Dependabot writes neither. So the four npm pins
in that table (TypeScript, `@types/node`, Biome, cpd) form their own `toolchain` group: its PR is
the one that needs the row and an entry here before merge, while the `libraries` group needs only
green CI. Two majors are ignored outright. TypeScript's, because `latest` is 7.x/tsgo, which §0.3
rules out (plan-notes 2). `@types/node`'s, because the types follow `.node-version`, the golden
ground truth: a types-only major would let `tsc` accept calls the pinned Node doesn't have.

**Cooldown: 7 days.** A release is proposed once it is a week old. The known compromised npm
releases were pulled within hours to days, and an exact pin protects nothing if it moves to the
bad version on day one. Security updates bypass the cooldown, but they are a repository setting —
off, as are vulnerability alerts — not something this file turns on.

**Out of reach, on purpose.** `.node-version`, `mise.toml`, `packageManager`, the vendored C
(`pnpm run vendor:update`, plan-notes 101) and the Test262 pin stay hand-bumped.

**Known risk: pnpm 12.** GitHub documents pnpm v7–v10 (dependabot-core's `main` lists v11). Its
pnpm manager never reports a version unsupported: the updater runs `corepack prepare
pnpm@12.3.4 --activate` and, if that fails, falls back to the pnpm already in its image. Both
write lockfile v9.0, and CI installs with a frozen lockfile under the pinned pnpm, so a lockfile
the pinned pnpm would not accept as-is fails the PR's CI instead of landing.

**Open.** Dependabot's commits and PRs are authored by `dependabot[bot]`. Whether golden rule 7
(plan-notes 211) reaches a bot's commit that the owner merges is the owner's call; this entry
doesn't decide it.

## 213. An exception reaching the CLI is STA4072 — the first one was the checker's own stack overflow (2026-09-11)

**Found by mining `packages/tests/test262/results.json`, not by fuzzing.** Of its 3,100 `failed`
rows, exactly ONE is not `STA0012`: `test/language/expressions/object/method-definition/
generator-prop-name-yield-expr.js`, whose reason is a Node crash inside
`node_modules/.pnpm/typescript@6.0.3/…/typescript.js:61580 RangeError: Maximum call stack size
exceeded` — the compiler process died with a stack trace instead of answering. Reproduced with the
corpus file directly (`node packages/compiler/src/cli/main.ts build <file> --mode=js`) and then
with a minimal 8-line program:

```js
var obj = null;
var yield = 'propNameViaIdentifier';
var iter = (function*() { obj = { *[yield]() {} }; })();
console.log(typeof iter);
```

The SHAPE matters and is worth recording: the recursion is the checker's contextual typing of the
assignment to a module-scope `var` (`getContextualTypeForAssignmentDeclaration` →
`getTypeOfExpression` → `checkIdentifier` → `getNarrowedTypeOfSymbol` → …). Moving `obj` inside the
generator, or dropping the `[yield]` computed key, stops it. **It is upstream, not Stator's**: plain
`tsc 6.0.3` with the same options dies on the same file. Nothing Stator can do about the recursion.

**It is a Stator bug anyway, and the reason is a written rule.** AGENTS.md: "User-facing failures
are diagnostics (stable STA code + span + mode), never thrown stack traces. A thrown exception
reaching the CLI is a compiler bug (STA4xxx)." `main()`'s catch handled `StatorError` and
`BuildError` and then did `throw error` for everything else — which is the traceback path, so the
contract had no last line of defence at all. It does now: any other exception becomes
`STA4072 internal error: {message} — this is a compiler bug; report it with the input that
triggered it`, exit 1, stderr, no frame ever printed.

**`STA4072` is allocated in `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md`**, in the lowering band's free tail
(STA4038–STA4039, STA4072–STA4079 were free; the band's paragraph now reads 4073–4079), with the
row naming the CLI as the raiser — the `STA4001` precedent (a CLI code sitting in the verifier's
band because that is where room was). The free-range line in the same file moved with it.

**Test.** `packages/tests/unit/cli.test.ts` → "an exception inside the checker is STA4072, not a
Node stack trace": the source above is written to a temp dir, built in js mode, and asserted to
exit 1 with `stator: STA4072 internal error: ` and `compiler bug` on stderr, plus
`assert.doesNotMatch(stderr, /\n\s+at /)` and no `typescript.js` frame. **Test262's own results
file is where this came from, and the corpus is 53k tests wide** — the cheapest way to hunt for
`STA4xxx`-class failures is to cluster that file by reason and look at everything that is not
`STA0012`, which is exactly what the one row above was.

## 214. The class table lost an inherited accessor, and the emitter threw (2026-09-11)

**Found by probing cross-feature combinations** (the fuzzer's grammar has no classes): a base class
with a getter/setter, a subclass that overrides ANY method, and a read of the inherited accessor
through the subclass. Minimal repro, js mode:

```js
class Base { describe() { return 'b'; } get double() { return 2; } }
class Derived extends Base { describe() { return 'd'; } }
const d = new Derived();
console.log(d.double);
```

Before the fix: `stator: STA4072 internal error: class Derived has no method get double` (a raw
stack trace before 213 landed, which is how the two bugs were found in the same hunt). Node prints
`2`; a 4-level chain behaves the same way.

**Cause.** The class table exists only where something is overridden, and it is built from
`type.methods` — the HType's WHOLE method list, inherited entries included. An accessor is a method
under a mangled name (`get x`, `accessorName` in `hir/types.ts`), so an inherited accessor is an
entry in the subclass's table. Resolving "which class implements this entry" went through
`methodDeclaringClass` (`frontend/types.ts`), which walks METHOD DECLARATIONS by name — a mangled
name matches none, so it answered `undefined` and `lowerClass` fell back to `type.name`. The entry
then named `Derived`, whose HIR `methods` list holds only its own members (the accessor's body
belongs to `Base`), and `methodId` in `src/codegen/index.ts` threw the message above. The gate
refuses an accessor OVERRIDE, so exactly one class in a chain ever declares a given accessor — the
fallback could never be right.

**Fix.** `accessorProperty(name)` in `hir/types.ts`, the inverse of `accessorName` and placed beside
it so the two cannot drift, and `methodDeclaringClass` routes a mangled name to
`accessorDeclaringClass`, which speaks source names and returns the declaring class. The most
derived declaration is still the implementor, for the reason above.

**Test.** `tests/golden/{js,ts}/inherited_accessor.*`: getter and setter in the base, a three-level
chain with `describe` overridden at two levels (that is what forces a table), reads and writes of
the inherited accessor from every level, a base-typed reference, and `instanceof` both ways —
byte-for-byte against the pinned Node. Both fixtures failed to BUILD before the fix, so they are
also the regression proof.

## 215. A block is a scope: the lowering's flat binding map leaked out of it (2026-09-11)

**Found by probing a block-scoped name after its block** — one probe, four symptoms, two of them
live wrong answers. `lowerBlock` lowered its statements with the CALLER's `Map<string, HType>`,
and so did the `for` and `for-in` headers and the `switch` clause list, so every block-scoped
declaration stayed resolvable where its scope had ended. The verifier already copies its scope map
per block (`verifyBlock`), so the two disagreed — and the disagreement had two faces:

- `{ let x = 1; } console.log(typeof x)` — the lowering resolved `x`, the verifier did not, and the
  result was `STA4002 internal error in identifier: identifier 'x' is not defined`. Node prints
  `undefined`. Same for `const`, a block function declaration, `try`/`finally` blocks, a case
  block, and `{ class C {} } console.log(typeof C)`.
- `for (let i = 0; i < 2; i += 1) {} console.log(typeof i)` printed **`number`** where Node prints
  `undefined` — the loop's slot still held its last value and the name still resolved to it. That is
  a silent wrong answer, the failure mode §0 exists to prevent, and nothing in the compiler reports
  it. `for (const x of …)` and `catch (e)` were already correct (both already lowered into a copy).

**Fix.** Each scope now lowers into `new Map(bindings)`: `lowerBlock`, `lowerFor` (header, condition,
increment, body), `lowerForIn` (its binding and its internal temporaries), and `lowerSwitch` (one
map for the whole clause list, which is one scope — the discriminant stays in the outer scope,
evaluated before it exists). `var` is unaffected by construction: `hoistVarDeclarations` registers
every `var` of a function/module into the enclosing map BEFORE any block is lowered, and the copies
inherit it, which is what keeps `{ var leaked = 'here'; } console.log(leaked)` correct.

**Tests.** `tests/golden/js/block_scope.js` — the out-of-scope half (`typeof` on a `let`, a `const`,
a block function, a block class; a caught `ReferenceError`; the `for` header; `var` surviving its
block; switch and try/finally blocks) and `tests/golden/ts/block_scope.ts` for the half ts mode can
express (it refuses `var` as STA1104 and refuses a read of an undeclared name as TS2304, so the ts
twin pins sibling blocks with same-named `let`s of DIFFERENT types — the case the flat map typed
from the second declaration — plus the `for` header and a function-scoped block). Both match Node
byte-for-byte; the js fixture's `typeof i` line printed `number` before the fix.

**This is the LEAK half of step 14, not the shadowing half.** plan.md §8 step 14 stays open and its
text now says so: a name RE-DECLARED in a nested scope still shares one slot with the outer one,
because every copy carries the same source name — `const x = 1; { const x = 2; }` still reads back
`2` for the outer `x`. Alpha-renaming at the lowering is what fixes that, and these copies are
compatible with it rather than a substitute for it.

## 216. Block scoping, the shadowing half: alpha-renaming at the lowering (2026-09-11)

**The defect** (plan-notes 209, plan.md §8 step 14): HIR names were SOURCE names, so two bindings
that share a spelling had one home everywhere downstream — the verifier's binding map, the
emitter's slot table, the capture analysis. `const x = 1; { const x = 2; } console.log(x)` printed
`2` where Node prints `1`. Nothing reported it: the HIR was well-formed and every consumer agreed
with every other one.

**The fix is alpha-renaming at the lowering.** `src/lower/scope.ts` replaces the bare
`Map<string, HType>` with a `Scope`: a source name maps to a type AND to the HIR name a reference
must use, and `declare(name, type)` returns the HIR name to emit the declaration under. A
declaration that would be a SECOND home for its name — a shadow of a visible binding, or a second
declaration of that name anywhere else in the same slot space — gets `\u0000shadow:<source>#<n>`,
which no source can spell. Nothing downstream learns that scopes exist: it only ever sees names
that are already distinct, which is what makes the change correct by construction for the verifier,
the passes and the emitter at once.

**The slot-space rule, not just visibility.** The first cut renamed only when the name was already
VISIBLE, and that is not enough — `{ const value = 'block'; push(() => value); } const value =
'module';` has no moment where both are visible, yet both are module-level globals and the emitter
allocates one slot per HIR name, so the second write landed in the slot the first closure still
read (measured: `module` twice where Node prints `block`, `module`). `Scope` therefore carries a
`unitDeclared` set — every name declared anywhere in the current FUNCTION unit — shared by that
unit's blocks and fresh at each function. A function's frame is its own slot space, so
`functionScope()` starts a new one, while `child()` (a block, a loop body, a clause list, a catch
clause) carries the set along.

**The capture analysis had to be told.** `analyzeCaptures` runs on the TypeScript AST and resolves
references by SYMBOL — which is exactly right, and exactly why its output is spelled in SOURCE
names. The emitter's `envMap`/`captureMap` are keyed by name, so a renamed binding's references
missed both and fell through to a global slot. Two changes: `CaptureInfo` now carries the
DECLARATION each `envVar` and each capture resolved to (the lowering spells them through a
`WeakMap<ts.Declaration, string>` filled at every `declare`), and the module environment's slot
list is built from DECLARATIONS rather than names — two loops at module level each declaring
`let i` are two bindings and need two slots, where the old name-keyed Set gave them one.
**A re-sort of that list had to go with it:** `lowerProgram` used to re-sort the union of every
file's `envVars`, which was idempotent while names were source spellings and is not once a renamed
name starts with U+0000 — every index after it pointed one slot off, and the golden fixture that
covers module-level per-iteration capture (`module_loop_capture`, both modes) caught it immediately.

**Refusal removed.** `gate.ts`'s `shadowsEnclosingBinding`/`bindsName` — step 12(e)'s deliberately
over-broad refusal for a block function declaration that shadows — are gone, with the defect they
named. `subset_block_function_shadow_{ts,js}` moved from `not-yet(STA1214)` to
`static`/`static`: the program is fully typed in both modes.

**Check evidence.** `tests/golden/js/block_shadow.js` covers the four shapes the Check names (a
`const`, a `let`, a parameter, a function declaration shadowed in nested blocks), plus four levels
of nesting, a shadow captured by a closure that outlives its block, a shadowing `catch` parameter,
assignment to a shadow (not just declaration) and a shadowing `for` header — all byte-for-byte
against the pinned Node. The subsets above moved as the Check requires, and `gate.ts` emits no
not-yet naming a shadowed block binding (the strings are gone from the file). Full suite:
unit 384/384, subset 364 (339 passed, 25 expected-fail, 0 failed), golden 177/177.

**Not claimed.** TDZ is still not modelled: `let x = x;`-style reads before a declaration are
refused by the checker in ts mode, and in js mode a reference the checker resolves to a later
declaration of the same name is lowered against whatever was visible at that point. That is a
separate defect from shadowing and this change neither fixes nor worsens it.

## 217. C trigraphs corrupted every emitted string literal containing `??` (2026-09-11)

**Found by the C-emitter audit** (one of four parallel audits run for the bug hunt). The generated C
is compiled with `-std=c11`, where trigraphs are ACTIVE, and the emitter escaped only `\n \t \r \\ "`
and non-printables — so a `?` in string content reached the C file raw.

```js
console.log("a??!b");   // Node: a??!b     Stator: a|b     (length still 5, so it over-read)
console.log("x??/");    // Node: x??/      Stator: clang error, "missing terminating '\"'", STA0009
```

**Fix.** `?` (0x3F) is emitted as `\?` in `escapeBytes`, and `cNameLiteral`/`escapeCString` share one
free `escapeCString` that escapes it too, so the three spellings cannot drift. `\?` is an ordinary
escape for the same character. **Test:** `tests/golden/{js,ts}/string_trigraph.*` — `??!`, `??/`,
`??(`, `??-`, a trailing `??`, `????`, a `?`-bearing dynamic property key and two string literals in
a ternary, byte-for-byte against Node (the js fixture's key needs the dynamic-object form; the ts
twin uses a `Map`, because an index signature is not in that mode's subset).

## 218. `do{…}while(false)` was rewritten to its body even when the body jumps (2026-09-11)

**Found by the passes audit.** `break` and `continue` name their target by POSITION, so deleting the
loop the dead-code pass proves dead retargets every jump inside it at the next enclosing construct —
or at nothing.

```js
for (let j = 0; j < 2; j++) { do { continue; } while (false); console.log("after " + j); }
// Node: after 0 / after 1      Stator: (nothing, exit 0) — the continue now skipped the print
let i = 0; do { i++; if (i < 5) break; i += 100; } while (false); console.log(i);
// Node: 1                      Stator: STA4029 internal error, "break has no an enclosing loop"
```

**Fix.** `dce.ts`'s `prune` declines the rewrite when `containsJump(stmt.body)` — a deliberately
COARSE test (any jump anywhere below, a nested loop's own `break` included), because the generic
walker knows no nesting and a declined rewrite costs one loop that stays in the output while the
opposite mistake costs a retargeted jump. **Test:** `tests/golden/{js,ts}/do_while_abrupt.*`,
including the labelled form and a jump-free do/while that still folds.

## 219. Inlining substituted a parameter name a NESTED function rebinds (2026-09-11)

**Found by the passes audit.** The inliner's condition 2 asks whether a body names anything but its
own parameters; a nested function's parameter with the same name answers "no" and is not one.

```ts
function shift(x: number): number {
  return [1, 2].map(function (x: number): number { return x * 10; })[0] as number;
}
// Node: 10     Stator: 70      (same as function f(a, b) { return (function (a) { return a*10; })(b); })
```

The substitution is textual over the whole result, so `x` was replaced inside the callback too.

**Fix.** `inline.ts` declines a candidate whose result contains a nested scope that binds any name
being substituted: `rebindsNested` walks the result as a synthetic one-statement block through the
generic rewriter and reports a nested `function` parameter or any nested `declaration` with one of
those names. Over-approximate on purpose — a declined inline costs nothing, a wrong one is a silent
wrong answer. **Test:** `tests/golden/ts/inline_nested_shadow.ts`.

## 220. `in` on a primitive: two wrong answers and a dropped catch block (2026-09-11)

**Found by the passes audit** (`const-fold` folded `"length" in "abc"` to `false`) and then widened
by the runtime audit's companion note and by hand while fixing it. Three defects met on one operator:

1. `const-fold`'s `case 'in': return false` — with two literal operands the right one is never an
   object, so the arm ALWAYS replaced a TypeError with an ordinary value.
2. `jsrt_in` answered instead of raising: `"length" in "abc"` returned `true` (through the string
   branch of `jsrt_has_prop`) and every other primitive returned `false`. §13.10.1 step 6 requires
   an Object right operand. The array index test also used `strtoul`, which accepts `'01'`, `'+1'`,
   `'-0'` and leading whitespace as indices where Node answers `false`; it now uses the file's own
   `array_index_value`.
3. **The emitter dropped the whole `catch`.** `emitTryCatch` skips emitting a handler when nothing
   jumped to its pad — sound only while every throwing operation emits a pending check. `in` had
   none, so `try { "length" in "abc" } catch (e) { … }` lost its catch entirely and printed `false`
   with the exception still pending. `emitBinaryOp` now gives `in` the `delete` treatment: the
   operands are sequenced into their slots, the answer lands in the left slot, and a pending check
   follows it. The optimization stays, with its invariant named in the comment it rests on.

**Tests.** `tests/golden/js/in_operator.js`: the four index spellings, `length`, present/absent keys
on a fixed and a dynamic object, a computed key, and all three primitive right operands raising a
catchable TypeError whose message matches Node's byte-for-byte. The `catch` not being dropped is
what the fixture is really pinning.

**Left alone, deliberately:** `JSON.parse("{")` still PANICS with STA2005 ("the spec throws
SyntaxError, which builtins cannot raise yet") instead of throwing a catchable SyntaxError. That is
the pending-exception protocol's own open item, not this operator's.

## 221. `console.assert(cond, msg)` evaluated the message BEFORE the condition (2026-09-11)

**Found by the C-emitter audit.** C evaluates function arguments in an unspecified order, and the
console entry points were the one runtime call the emitter did not sequence through rooted slots.

```ts
function f(a: number[]): string { a[0] = 99; return "mutated"; }
const a: number[] = [1];
console.assert(a[0] === 1, f(a));   // Node: no output     Stator: "Assertion failed: mutated"
```

**Fix.** `consoleCall` sequences two-or-more arguments into contiguous rooted slots, left to right,
before the call — the same discipline `emitExpression('call')` uses. Fewer than two keep the direct
path (no order to fix, nothing can run between the evaluation and the call), and `countExpression`
claims slots only in the multi-argument case; claiming them unconditionally left a frame slot
nothing wrote, which the frame audit in `tests/unit/frames.test.ts` caught immediately. **Test:**
`tests/golden/ts/console_assert_order.ts`.

## 222. The runtime audit's memory-safety and semantics findings, and three frontend ones (2026-09-11)

**Numbering note:** a parallel edit in this working tree (the `oxlint`/`oxfmt` migration,
`.oxlintrc.json`) also cites 222. Whichever entry lands second should take the next free number and
update its references; this one is the bug-hunt record for the runtime and frontend fixes below.

Four parallel audits (runtime C, C emitter, optimization passes, frontend) were run for the bug
hunt. The compiler-side findings are 217–221; this entry is the runtime's, plus three that came out
of the frontend audit, and it is the batch where the pattern is the same in every case: a value that
is LIVE but UNROOTED, or a conversion the spec requires and the runtime skipped.

### Memory safety: a NaN-boxed local is not a root

`docs/VALUE.md` §4.1 and `jsrt_gc.c`'s own header say it plainly — Boehm scans the stack
conservatively, and a NaN-boxed `jsrt_value` has the box's high bits, so it is not a pointer by any
conservative test. Every intermediate that must survive another allocation therefore belongs in a
`JSRT_FRAME`/`JSRT_LOCAL`. Six sites held one in a plain C local instead:

| Site | What broke (measured) |
|---|---|
| `jsrt_regexp.c` `match_array` | `s.match(re)` in a loop answered `m.length` = 49314864 / 52476976 / 71023664 across runs instead of 2 |
| `jsrt_ops.c` `jsrt_op_add` | `(v + []).length` summed 999685 of 1000000 — whole iterations contributed 0, because the ToPrimitive of the LEFT operand was collected while the right one was built |
| `jsrt_json.c` `parse_array`/`parse_object`/`jsrt_json_parse` | the half-built container (and the source text, held in a `Parser` struct on the C stack) outlived a collection: SIGSEGV inside `jsrt_array_set`, 2 of 3 runs of a 500k-iteration parse loop |
| `jsrt_promise.c` `jsrt_promise_construct` | the promise the executor resolves is reachable from nothing while the env and the two resolver closures allocate |
| `jsrt_error.c` `jsrt_error_new` | name and message were stored across `jsrt_string_from_utf8`/`jsrt_object_new` |
| `jsrt_regexp.c` `jsrt_regexp_to_string`, `match_groups`, `jsrt_regexp_match`, `jsrt_regexp_split` | each builds a string or an array while the previous partial result is live |

**Regression test:** `tests/golden/js/gc_rooting.js` — 200k `match`, 200k `parse + []`, 100k nested
parse, all summed. It is what found the JSON one: the fixture's three loops together SIGSEGV'd 2 of
3 runs while each loop alone passed.

### Semantics the spec fixes and the runtime skipped

- **`String.prototype.concat` never coerced its argument.** It is emitted as the internal
  concatenation PRIMITIVE, which asserts both sides are strings, so `''.concat(42)`,
  `''.concat(true)`, `''.concat(null)` and `''.concat(undefined)` all aborted in `as_string`.
  §22.1.3.4 runs ToString per argument. The emitter now wraps the argument the same way it wraps a
  template literal's holes. Test: `tests/golden/js/concat_coercion.js`.
- **Promise adoption had no `[[AlreadyResolved]]`.** `new Promise((res, rej) => { res(inner);
  rej(err) })` rejected, because the adoption branch returns with the promise still PENDING and the
  later `reject` settled it — Node resolves to the inner value. `JSRTPromise` now carries a
  `resolved` flag consumed by the first settlement (value, rejection, or adoption), and adoption
  goes straight to the state change, since its own resolution was already consumed. Tests:
  `tests/golden/js/promise_adoption.js` (adoption, double resolve, reject-then-resolve,
  resolve-a-rejected-promise, and a 2000-iteration construction loop).
- **Date setters could not tell an omitted component from an explicit NaN.** The `+0` recovery for
  an Invalid Date (§21.4.4.21) overwrote every NaN field, including the caller's: `new
  Date(NaN).setUTCFullYear(NaN)` answered `-62167219200000` (year 0) instead of NaN, and once the
  lowering padded optional arguments with `undefined`, `setUTCFullYear(2024)` could not recover at
  all. The setters now pass a bitmask of the components the caller actually supplied. Test:
  `tests/golden/js/date_setter_nan.js`.
- **`new Error(undefined).message` aborted.** The slot is a string by HIR type; the runtime stored
  whatever it was handed, so `.message.length` asserted. The message now goes through ToString with
  undefined → `""`. Test: `tests/golden/ts/error_message_coercion.ts`.
- **`new Date(NaN).toISOString()` pended a bare string.** `jsrt_throw_str` pends the message alone,
  so `e instanceof RangeError` was false and `e.name` undefined — for the one throw in the runtime a
  program is most likely to catch. It throws a RangeError object now. Test:
  `tests/golden/js/range_error_iso.js`.

### Frontend

- **`this` inside an arrow inside a method was a capture the analysis could not see (STA4072).**
  `analyzeCaptures` collects `ts.isIdentifier` nodes and `this` is a keyword, so
  `[1,2].map(() => this.n)` inside a method reached the emitter with no binding and threw
  "Undefined identifier:  this". The receiver is a parameter like any other — under an unspellable
  name — so the walk now records a `ThisKeyword` whose nearest enclosing non-arrow function is the
  owner, with `RECEIVER_NAME` exported from `captures.ts` and imported by the lowering so the name
  is spelled once. Tests: `tests/golden/{js,ts}/arrow_this.*`.
- **`o["k"] = v` on a fixed shape was STA4044.** The read path already reduced a string-literal key
  to a field access; the write path built an index node, which the verifier rejects on a layout — so
  `o["n"] = 5` failed while `(o["n"] += 1)` compiled, and a key that is not an identifier has no
  other spelling. `memberAssignment` now makes the same reduction. Tests:
  `tests/golden/{js,ts}/index_assignment.*`.

```text
unit 385; pass 385; fail 0
subset: 364 fixtures — 339 passed, 25 expected-fail, 0 failed
golden: 194 fixtures — 194 passed, 0 failed
runtime: print corpus matches Node
builtins: Promise.prototype 3/3 (100%)
```

## 223. Open findings from the bug hunt that are NOT fixed, with their repros (2026-09-11)

Everything below was confirmed by running Node against a Stator build. None is fixed yet; each is
recorded here so it is not lost, and the first two are defects in shipped constructs that deserve
plan steps of their own rather than a quiet entry.

**1. `await` (or `yield`) inside a per-iteration-env loop resumes into the middle of a C block.**
PRE-EXISTING — verified by stashing this session's work, rebuilding the runtime and reproducing on
the pristine tree (SIGTRAP, exit 133).

```js
async function main() {
  await Promise.resolve(1);
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i += 1) {
    const p = new Promise(function (resolve) { resolve(i); });
    if (i === 2) { console.log(await p); }
  }
  console.log('done');
}
main();
// Node: 2 / done        Stator: SIGTRAP (-O2), works at -O0
```

The emitted C opens the loop body with `JSRTEnv *_jsrt_saved_env_0 = _jsrt_env;` and
`JSRTEnv *_jsrt_iter_env_0 = NULL;`, and the resume label `_jsrt_res_N:` for the await sits INSIDE
that block. Resumption jumps past those initializers, so both variables are indeterminate — clang
at -O2 turns the resulting UB into `brk #1` (a trap), which is what the exit status is. Nothing in
`tests/golden` awaits inside a loop with a captured binding, which is why the suite is green. The
fix is the emitter's: either hoist the loop's suspension state into the frame/environment (the way
`try`/`finally` already parks its completion code in a slot) or route the resume through a
per-loop re-entry that re-establishes the C locals.

**2. An interface-typed value is a fixed layout whose HType is `unknown`.** The two layers disagree,
and which one wins depends on the operation: a `delete` or a dynamic write reads the type as
"dynamic, allowed" and then aborts at run time, while a field read reads it as a dynamic read and
fails the verifier.

```ts
interface O { x?: number; y?: number }
const o: O = { x: 1, y: 2 };
console.log(`${delete o.x}`);   // Node: true      Stator: PANIC STA2007
```
```js
const a = [];
const e = new Error(a[0]);      // `new Error(...)` is the Error INTERFACE
console.log(e.message);         // Node: ""        Stator: STA4059 internal error
```
`objectLiteralIsDynamic` (`frontend/types.ts`) sends a literal to the dynamic representation only
when its anonymous symbol is an `ObjectLiteral|TypeLiteral`, and an `interface` is neither, while
`tsTypeToHType` types the interface `unknown`. The fix is a decision, not a patch: either an
interface with an optional/index trigger is dynamic like its anonymous twin, or it is a fixed
`object` and every context that reads `unknown` as "dynamic" learns the difference.

**3. `{ ...o }` enumerates in the TYPE's field order, not the source object's key order.**

```js
/** @type {{y: number, x: string}} */
const o = { x: "s", y: 2 };
const p = { ...o };
console.log(Object.keys(p).join(","));   // Node: x,y     Stator: y,x
```

The expansion is a compile-time field read per field of `source.type.fields`; the runtime object's
enumeration order lives in its `JSRTClass::key_order`, which the HType does not carry. Fixing it
means giving the type the order (or spreading through a runtime helper).

**4. `fn.length` on an untyped function value answers `undefined`.**

```js
const g = (x) => x;
function arity(fn) { return fn.length; }
console.log(arity(g));   // Node: 1     Stator: undefined
```

A closure has no shape, so the read falls through to the shape table. `docs/VALUE.md` §4.16 also
records that a method's closure constant currently counts the receiver in its arity — so
implementing `length` needs that paid first, or methods would answer one too many.

**5. An array method on a value the checker called an Array but that is `undefined` at run time
SEGFAULTS** where Node throws.

```js
function add(v) { arr.push(v); }
add(1);
var arr = [];
// Node: TypeError, exit 1        Stator: SIGSEGV, exit 139
```

`jsrt_as_array` unboxes the payload with no tag test, so `undefined` gives NULL. A tag check that
panics (or throws) is the fix; it needs a `STA200x` code allocated in `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md`.

**6. Smaller, all confirmed, all still open.** `'ab'.replace(/(?<x>a)/, '[$<x>]')` prints `[$<x>]b`
where Node prints `[a]b` (no `$<name>` branch in the replacement expander, `jsrt_regexp.c`);
`Date.parse("2024-01-01T24:00:01Z")` answers `1704153601000` where Node answers NaN (hour 24 is
accepted with non-zero minutes/seconds, `jsrt_date.c`); and a method call on an Unknown receiver —
`function pushIt(a) { a.push(9); }` — panics with STA2006 where Node runs, because `jsrt_get_prop`
walks shape tables only and never a class descriptor or a builtin prototype (plan-notes 180 records
the primitive half as known residue).

## 224. Biome replaced by oxlint + oxfmt (2026-09-11)

**Touches:** plan §4 Task 1.0 (toolchain), §15.4 rule 7, `docs/TOOLCHAIN.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
`.github/dependabot.yml`, `packages/compiler/moon.yml`, a new `.oxlintrc.json` + `.oxfmtrc.json`,
and the deletion of `biome.json`.

**Numbering.** The runtime-audit entry in this same working tree (## 222) anticipates this migration
and asks the later writer to move; this one landed second, so it is 224 (223 being that audit's open
findings) and `.oxlintrc.json`'s header cites 224.

**Change.** One Rust binary doing lint *and* format (`@biomejs/biome` 2.5.11, notes #19) became the
oxc pair: `oxlint` 1.82.0 for lint, `oxfmt` 0.67.0 for format, plus `oxlint-tsgolint` 7.0.2001 — the
`typescript-go` backend the type-aware rules run through. Lockfile package entries: 106 → 113 (the
`@biomejs/*` tree out, the two tools' platform bindings and the tsgolint tree in). The dependency
budget rule (AGENTS.md) is still satisfied by subtraction against the ESLint tree #19 removed; the
one genuinely new dependency is tsgolint, and what it buys is the exhaustiveness rule below at full
strength.

**Rule parity, rule by rule.** Biome's `recommended` preset and oxlint's categories are different
sets and no converter maps them, so the policy is written out in `.oxlintrc.json`: the whole
`correctness` and `suspicious` categories as errors, the load-bearing rules by name, and every rule
that is switched off carrying the count of existing findings that made it a decision.

- The four load-bearing rules are enabled by name (`no-explicit-any`, `no-non-null-assertion`,
  `consistent-type-imports`, `switch-exhaustiveness-check`) and each was **proved to still fire** on
  a throwaway fixture violating all four (`oxlint packages/tests/unit/zz_lint_parity_probe.ts`
  reported all four; the file was then deleted).
- `switch-exhaustiveness-check` carries `considerDefaultExhaustiveForUnions: true`, which is the
  semantics Biome's `useExhaustiveSwitchCases` had: a `default:` arm covers a union. Without it the
  rule reported 11 switches that end in `default: return false;` (const-fold, DCE, inline, the HIR
  verifier) — a *stricter* policy than the one being migrated, and one that would demand ~50-case
  switches over the HIR's `Expression`/`Statement` kinds.
- Three rules Biome had in `recommended` sit in oxlint's *pedantic* category and are named
  explicitly: `eqeqeq` (Biome `noDoubleEquals`), `no-self-compare` (`noSelfCompare`), `no-fallthrough`
  (`noFallthroughSwitchClause`). `no-fallthrough` needs `allowEmptyCase: true`: stacked `case` labels
  with an explanatory comment between them (10 sites) are how this codebase documents a shared arm,
  while a case with a body that falls into the next one is still an error — verified with a fixture
  that does both.
- `restrict-template-expressions` carries `allowNever: true`: `const _exhaustive: never = node` is
  the exhaustiveness witness and the witness is what the STA4xxx "cannot happen" message
  interpolates (2 sites, `hir/verify.ts`).
- Off, with counts: `no-floating-promises` 141 (every one inside a `node:test` body — the runner
  owns `test()`'s promise; Biome kept this rule nursery), `no-unsafe-type-assertion` 114 and
  `no-unnecessary-type-assertion` 56 (an `as` that narrows a runtime-guarded `ts.Type` to a known
  method name is this compiler's idiom), `no-unnecessary-condition` 87, unicorn's
  `no-array-sort`/`no-array-reverse`/`consistent-function-scoping` 15/3/3, `no-underscore-dangle` 6
  (`_exhaustive` is the convention, not a dangle), `no-shadow` 2, `consistent-return` 2
  (`applyBinary`/`applyUnary` answer "not foldable" by falling out of the switch), and `dot-notation`
  (parity: Biome's `useLiteralKeys` was off).
- `no-unnecessary-condition` is off for a **different reason** than in notes #19: with real types it
  reports 87 findings, not the single `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` false positive that motivated the
  original decision. The verdict survives; its evidence is now measured instead of inferred.
- New gate property: `reportUnusedDisableDirectives: "error"`. A suppression that stops suppressing
  is a stale claim about the code, and this migration creates the first batch of them.
- Type-aware linting is `options.typeAware: true`, so the gate needs `oxlint-tsgolint` installed; it
  fails loudly rather than silently skipping those rules. tsgolint's docs ask for TypeScript 7.0+,
  and it runs against this repo's pinned **6.0.3** tsconfigs today — re-check that at the next
  TypeScript bump.

**Suppressions translated.** Eight `biome-ignore` comments became `oxlint-disable-next-line`: five in
`tests/unit/numeric-spec.test.ts` (the IEEE-754 claims, including the `erasing-op` one whose rule
folds `0 * -1` to zero — the exact transform the "`0 * -1` is -0" canary forbids), one in
`tests/test262/harness/done.js` for `$DONE`, two in `passes/constfold.ts` for the `==`/`!=` arms that
model the operators. Leaving them was not an option: an unknown directive is just a comment, so
every one of those claims would have become a finding.

**Findings fixed, not suppressed.** The wider rule set surfaced three real ones.
`codegen/index.ts` wrapped a string in a template literal it did not need
(``this.appendLine(`${parkCall}`, span)``); `tests/unit/helpers.ts` made a parameter optional with
`= undefined` where `?` says the same thing; `tests/test262/run.ts` sorted skip counts with a bare
`.sort()`, which compares the *concatenated* `feature,count` string — it now compares features, as
the two other sorts in that file already did. Two findings are suppressed at the site, with the
reason on the line: `new Array<R>(n)` as a preallocated result array (`unicorn/no-new-array`), and
the specialization loop's condition (`no-unmodified-loop-condition` cannot see the `failed` flag that
the same loop's `walkCalls` sets).

**Format parity.** `oxfmt --migrate=biome` mapped the style, and the result is that the formatter
disagreed with Biome on **two lines of source**: a `for (…; …; )` header Biome spaced before the `)`
(`lower/captures.ts`, two occurrences) and one 101-column line in `lower/index.ts`. Everything else
that changed is the three `package.json` manifests, whose keys oxfmt sorts (`sortPackageJson` is on
by default; kept).

**A trap worth recording: oxfmt honours `.editorconfig`.** The first `oxfmt --check` run reported all
86 files as misformatted. The cause was a developer `~/.editorconfig` (a .NET-era file) saying
`end_of_line = crlf`, which oxfmt walks up to and applies. Biome defaults `formatter.useEditorconfig`
to **false** and deliberately ignores `.editorconfig` files above a `biome.json`, "to avoid loading
formatting settings from someone's home directory" — oxfmt has no such guard, so this is new surface
and would have rewritten the whole tree on the next `pnpm run format`. `.oxfmtrc.json` pins
`endOfLine: "lf"` for that reason; the pin is load-bearing for anyone whose home directory carries an
`.editorconfig`.

**Scope: the formatter's file set is the one Biome checked** (TypeScript/JavaScript/JSON, named by a
glob in the `lint`/`format` scripts). oxfmt can also format Markdown, YAML and TOML; that is
deliberately not enabled — `plan.md` and `plan-notes.md` are the normative record and are hand-
wrapped, and reformatting them would bury the migration in a docs diff. Widening it is a one-line
change in two scripts if the owner wants it.

**`pnpm run lint` is two commands now** (`oxlint --deny-warnings . && oxfmt --check <glob>`), because
one binary no longer does both: `--deny-warnings` replaces Biome's `--error-on-warnings`, and
`pnpm run format` is `oxlint --fix` followed by `oxfmt`. The same command pair is what
`packages/compiler/moon.yml`'s `lint` task runs.

**Not rewritten:** `done.md` still quotes `biome check` output (65, 85, 94 files) from the runs that
actually happened. It is an archive; those numbers are evidence of that day, not instructions.

**Check** (`mise exec node --`, Node 26.8.2, on the migration commit with a clean tree):
`pnpm run ci` → `stator: node v26.8.2 matches .node-version (26.7.0)`; tsc both projects clean;
lint `Found 0 warnings and 0 errors. Finished in 1.1s on 84 files with 162 rules` + oxfmt
`All matched files use the correct format. Finished in 14ms on 96 files`; `cpd` under the 1% gate;
runtime built; `ℹ tests 385 / ℹ pass 385 / ℹ fail 0`; `runtime: print corpus matches Node`;
`subset: 364 fixtures — 339 passed, 25 expected-fail, 0 failed`; `golden: 194 fixtures — 194 passed,
0 failed`; `builtins: 222/238 surface members landed (93%)`; `leak: 10M objects — peak RSS 3040 KB
of a 65536 KB cap, 46 samples, plateau`; ASan/UBSan runtime corpus and golden both green. The leak
gate samples RSS with `ps`, so it cannot run under a sandbox that hides other processes — the first
run of the chain reported `only 0 RSS samples ... FAILED` for that reason alone, and the same
command passed once `ps` was visible. Nothing in this migration touches the runtime or that harness;
the count is recorded so the next reader does not chase it.

## 225. Step 16: an interface is the same type as its anonymous twin (2026-09-11)

The plan's step 16 named two failures that looked unrelated and are one decision: `interface O { x?:
number }` + `delete o.x` aborted at run time with STA2007 where Node answers `true`, and
`new Error('x').message` inline was STA4059 (an internal error) where Node answers `"x"`. Both are
the same disagreement — the frontend typed a value one way and the runtime represented it another —
and both are now fixed at the two places the type is decided.

**1. `isDynamicShape` accepts an INTERFACE.** `docs/SUBSET.md`'s row sends an object literal with an
optional property to the shape table, and it said "the CONTEXTUAL type decides"; the test that
implemented it required the symbol to be an anonymous `ObjectLiteral|TypeLiteral`, and an interface
is `SymbolFlags.Interface`. So `const o: O = { x: 1, y: 2 }` was emitted as a FIXED layout while its
HType was Unknown — and Unknown is what `delete` and a dynamic write read as "dynamic, allowed", so
the gate passed and the runtime aborted against a layout that cannot lose a slot. A CLASS stays off
that list, deliberately: a class instance has a declared layout and that layout is the point of ts
mode. `tests/golden/ts/interface_shape.ts` is the proof (delete, `in`, a write, an anonymous twin).

**2. The five standard error interfaces map to `errorHType`.** `new Error('x')` lowers to an
`error-new` node typed `errorHType`, but `tsTypeToHType` sent the `Error` interface to Unknown — so a
binding `const e = new Error('x')` was Unknown (reads went dynamic and happened to work, because the
runtime's shape-table get falls back to a fixed slot) while the INLINE `new Error('x').message` had a
concretely-typed target on a dynamic node, which the verifier rejects. The mapping is by lib
interface name, exactly as `Date` and `RegExp` already were. **One wrinkle the first cut hit:** the
lib declaration of `Error` carries `stack?: string`, so once interfaces counted as dynamic shapes the
generic trigger read every Error as "can lose a key" and sent `e.message` back through the shape
table — `isDynamicShape` therefore excludes the five interfaces explicitly, with that reason in the
code. `tests/golden/ts/error_family.ts` is the proof.

**Decision fixtures moved with the truth:** `subset_error_construct_{ts,js}` were `dynamic` and their
own comment said "modelling the interface would make it static (plan-notes 195)" — they are `static`
now, which is the prediction coming true rather than a fixture bent to fit.

**A deliberate non-change:** `shapeTypeToHType` still refuses an interface. Making a REQUIRED-property
interface a structural layout would type `const p: P = new C()` as `{…}` while the runtime value
carries C's own descriptor, and a field order that differs between the two would read the wrong slot
with no check in between — the anonymous spelling has that hazard already, and this change does not
widen it. The optional/index case is the one whose runtime representation actually changes.

```text
golden: 197 fixtures — 197 passed, 0 failed
subset: 364 fixtures — 339 passed, 25 expected-fail, 0 failed
unit 385; pass 385; fail 0
```

## 226. Step 15: the loop's suspension state lives in slots, and the frame parks its environment (2026-09-11)

**The defect** (plan.md §8 step 15, plan-notes 223): `await`/`yield` inside a loop whose body
captures the loop binding SIGTRAP'd at `-O2`. The emitter declared the loop's environment state as C
locals INSIDE the loop body and put the resume label in that same block, so a resume jumped past the
initializers and both were indeterminate — clang turned the resulting UB into `brk #1`.

**Two changes, and the second is the one that makes it work.**

1. **The state is slots, not C locals.** `iterEnvSlots` claims two slots per per-iteration loop while
   counting, and `emitIterEnvOpen/Enter/Commit` read and write them through `slotAt` — so a sync
   unit gets frame slots and an async or generator unit gets ENVIRONMENT slots, which already
   survive a suspension for exactly this reason (`slotAt`'s own comment says so). The slots hold a
   raw `JSRTEnv *` bit-cast into a `jsrt_value`; that is deliberate and safe, because the collector's
   mark procedure masks every word of a collected object and marks what looks like a pointer, so a
   pointer in a slot is traced where a NaN-boxed VALUE would not be. Nothing reads these slots as
   values, and the names are unspellable.

2. **`_jsrt_self->env = _jsrt_env;` before every park.** The resume prologue opens with
   `JSRTEnv *_jsrt_env = _jsrt_self->env;`, and `JSRTAsync.env` was only ever written once, by
   `jsrt_async_start` — so a resume came back on the loop's BASE environment while the body's
   remaining code reads and writes the iteration's CLONE. First measurement after change 1: `i` stuck
   at 2 and the loop printing `2` forever (5,922,816 lines in two seconds). For every async unit
   whose environment never changes this stores the pointer it already holds, which is why no fixture
   had ever noticed the omission.

**Check evidence.** `tests/golden/js/suspend_in_loop.js` — an async loop with a captured binding and
an await in every iteration, nested loops each capturing their own binding, a `break` out of a loop
after an await, and a generator that yields from a captured loop — byte-for-byte against the pinned
Node, at `-O2`, which is where the trap used to be. `tests/golden/js/promise_adoption.js` regained
the `await`-inside-a-2000-iteration-loop stress it had to drop while the defect was open; that loop
is what brought it to light.

```text
golden: 197 fixtures — 197 passed, 0 failed
subset: 364 fixtures — 339 passed, 25 expected-fail, 0 failed
unit 385; pass 385; fail 0
runtime: print corpus matches Node
```




## 257. Step 38: `for-in` over arrays and strings, and a both-modes checker suppression (2026-09-15)

**Plan:** §8 Phase 5 step 38 lands as carded. `plan.md` unchanged (the card already orders it).

The B12 panic (`jsrt_object_keys` on arrays) was the smaller half. The larger half was the
checker's TS2407, which refuses `for-in` over a string (and over `unknown`) in BOTH modes —
including js mode, where refusing untyped code violates §1.2. The fix:

- `collect` (`jsrt_object_ops.c`) walks arrays (indices, then named extras through the array's
  own shape table) and strings (code-unit indices) first, per OrdinaryOwnPropertyKeys.
- The `for-in` desugar emits a new total entry, `forInKeys` (`jsrt_object_for_in_keys`): the
  keys walk for objects/arrays/strings, an empty list for every other primitive. `Object.keys`
  itself stays a loud STA4084 off-layout, so sharing the walk would have turned the suppressed
  2407 on `for (const k in 5)` from a compile-time refusal into a runtime abort.
- 2407 is suppressed through a new `BOTH_MODES_RUNTIME_CODES` set (`frontend/program.ts`),
  not the js-only one.

**The ts-mode contract tension, recorded honestly:** tsc rejects `for-in` over a string, and
Stator ts mode now compiles it — with byte-exact Node semantics, proved by goldens in both
modes. The §1.1 contract ("must type-check") bends here for the same reason the 2a buckets
bent in js: 2407 is a lint-grade refusal of a program with an exact runtime answer, not a
type error, and the ts encoding represents the answer (unlike 2790's fixed-shape delete,
which stays refused in ts precisely because no encoding exists). If the owner wants ts to
keep the refusal, revert the `BOTH_MODES` half to js-only in one line; the runtime stays.

## 258. Steps 18–38 consolidated; triage residue becomes steps 39–40 (2026-09-15)

**The consolidation.** Steps 18–38 landed in `49d8193` (18–27), `6ed9f77` (28–37) and `5a83a1d`
(38) but `plan.md` still listed all twenty-one as open — golden rule 1 debt. Four verification
agents (one per step group) rebuilt every step's goldens in both modes against the pinned Node
26.7.0 plus the subset runner: all Checks pass, no code changes, tree clean. `plan.md` now carries
struck stubs pointing at `done.md` → Phase 5 steps 18–38, where the per-batch evidence lives.
`6ed9f77`'s message under-names its batch ("33–37" while also carrying 28–32); history stands, the
`done.md` entry is the correction.

**The triage.** A fifth agent probed everything else still open in §8 (step 12(c)–(f) residue, step
2a(b)/(c) leftovers, Task 6.12, Phase 7 tail) with 3-line repros in `/tmp/stator-probes/`. Findings:

- Step 12(d) landed far broader than its prose (static getters/setters, static blocks, index
  signatures, method overloads, pre-super validation, optional members with defaults, explicit type
  args on `new`); the prose still claims several of them as residue. The prose is not corrected in
  this change — the residue table below is the sharper record, and a prose pass can follow the next
  landings rather than churn ahead of them.
- Step 12 residue, precisely bounded: uninitialized optional class fields, non-`Symbol.iterator`
  computed member names, `#private` re-declared in a subclass, static `#private` accessors, class
  expressions (no `ClassExpression` case in `gateConstruct` — the "classes" catch-all), generic
  bases, nested generic classes, class-as-value / `super`-as-value (blocked on the class object),
  bare generics as value. Spread residue: spread of an array without fixed shape, spread of a
  methods-carrying literal.
- Step 2a leftovers confirmed still refused in js mode (2683, 2769, 2464, 2488, 2454) with exact fix
  locations; 2683's option flip alone would only reclassify (needs a dynamic-`this` mechanism), and
  the first 2769 probe was a false positive (non-overloaded calls already run through the 2345 path).
  Open verdicts for the owner: TS2416 override-mismatch in js (keep as real refusal vs suppress),
  2769 fallback semantics (permissive like the 2345 path, or boundary abort).
- Task 6.12 is code-complete (`mise.toml` exact `26.7.0`, full-version compare in
  `scripts/check-node.mjs`); only its `pnpm run ci` green clause is unverified here.
- Two adjacent bugs are new plan work, added as steps 39–40 in the same change: spread of an
  unknown value throwing `STA4082` (gate accepts, verifier rejects — the step-37 shape outside its
  five cases), and lowering diagnostics mislabeling the mode as `[ts]` under `--mode=js` (~30 sites;
  fix threads the mode for labeling only, per §0.8).

## 259. Wave 2 landed: steps 39–40 plus three triage slices (2026-09-15)

Five parallel slices in `6f88a8b` (steps 39, 40, uninit optional fields, spread methods, 2464 —
evidence in `done.md` → Phase 5 steps 39–40). Three things worth recording:

- **The wave caught its own integration bugs.** `frames.test.ts` failed on the new
  `spread_methods.ts` (a spreads-only dynamic literal reserved a value scratch it never writes —
  fixed in `dynLiteralBaseSlots`, which now reserves the slot only when an entry stores through
  it), and `class-members.test.ts` pinned the optional-field refusal the wave removed (updated to
  the landed behavior). Neither agent ran the FULL unit suite — each ran targeted files — so the
  main thread owns a full-suite pass before committing multi-agent waves. Recorded as process, not
  blame: the frames gap was also a genuine pre-existing shape (any spreads-only dynamic literal),
  merely first exercised by S-C's golden.
- **`pnpm run …` is broken under mise on this host** (native-binary shim SyntaxError) — two agents
  independently reported it and ran the underlying binaries (`tsc`, `oxlint`, `oxfmt`, `cpd`,
  `run.ts`) directly via `mise exec node --`. Same underlying cause as plan-notes 204's moon
  wrapping note. `pnpm run ci` from a raw child process remains unusable here; moon tasks or
  direct binaries are the working routes.
- **Left for follow-ups:** spread of a union of arrays (`STA4082`, deserves compilation);
  `o[kObj]` reads (TS2538, separate suppression decision); TS2416 override-mismatch in js and
  2769 fallback semantics (owner verdicts from note 258, still open); Task 6.12's `ci`-green clause.

## 260. Wave 3 landed: class surface + 2a residue (2026-09-15)

Five slices in `7e9079d` (evidence in `done.md` → Phase 5 wave 3). Process notes:

- **Shared-tree collisions are now routine, not exceptional.** Wave 3 had two (S-F vs the
  computed-names refactor; spread-slice vs live `gate.ts` edits). Both resolved by the refactor
  owners with the reporter verifying intact hunks. Next wave uses separate worktrees per slice if
  the slices share files — recommended twice now (notes 258-area triage, wave-3 spread report).
- **The nullable method-value read (`c?.m` → `undefined`, Node: the function)** is triaged but
  ownerless; it rides with the 2454-adjacent receiver work or the next class-value slice.
- **Test262 ratchet drift is pre-existing:** 2372→2371 passed gap reproduces on the base commit
  without any wave-3 change. The 2454 landing moves 88 failed→skipped with zero passed→failed,
  which is the honest direction; `ratchet.json` stays untouched until the drift itself is owned.

## 261. Wave 4 landed: generics, class values, receivers (2026-09-15)

Five slices in `93af561` (evidence in `done.md` → Phase 5 wave 4). Decisions worth keeping:

- **TS2416 (override kind-mismatch) is a REAL REFUSAL Stator keeps**, on measured evidence: no
  fixed layout represents field+method under one name, and base-typed access would answer wrong
  rather than crash. Joins the strict-mode family and 2790's fixed-shape delete as refusals that
  look like §1.2 violations but are representation impossibilities. Reopen only with a layout
  that holds both (Phase-8 dictionary dispatch is the named mechanism).
- **Class-as-value needs no class object** for the landed slices — alias erasure carries
  construction, `instanceof`, and statics with zero runtime. The remaining class-object work is
  now exactly: opaque uses (`foo(K)`, `console.log(K)`), `super`-as-value (scoped pointers in
  the wave report), and whatever Phase 7/10 needs of first-class classes.
- **Remaining Phase-5 surface after wave 4:** bare generics as value, `super`-as-value,
  `extends <expression>`/mixins, static `#private` gaps (if any beyond the landed pair rule),
  spread-of-non-identifier computed fallout, `o[kObj]` TS2538, RegExpExecArray spread,
  fixed-param/dynamic-arg miscompile, `c?.m` unions-of-two-classes/`any`-mixing. Plus owner
  verdicts already recorded (2769 permissive-fallback consistency, TS2416 now settled above).

## 262. Wave 5 landed; step 45 owns the remaining boundary edges (2026-09-15)

Four slices in `a84a970` (evidence in `done.md` → Phase 5 wave 5). Notes:

- **cpd sits exactly at the gate (1.0%, 106 clones).** The next wave that adds code must
  extract or it goes red — treat clone-budget as a first-class constraint when slicing (shared
  helpers over per-site copies; the wave-2 codegen helpers are the model).
- **Step 45 is the honest remainder of step 44:** return/decl/assign edges miscompile dynamic
  values into fixed bindings as silent garbage, with the two regressions the first attempt hit
  (`spread_key_order`, `class_generic_base`) named in the Check so the fix proves it avoided
  them rather than asserting it.
- **Test262 note:** 2371 passed / 2159 failed / 49050 skipped with zero TS2538 records;
  `ratchet.json` untouched (drift from note 260 still pre-existing).

## 263. Wave 6 landed; step 46 owns the decl×return joint fixpoint (2026-09-15)

Two slices in `2ac7e4d` (evidence in `done.md` → Phase 5 wave 6). The integration gap is
precisely scoped: each pass's marks are invisible to the other (calls vs bindings, disjoint
keyspaces by design), so the combination needs either return marks fed into the slots pass or
decl-side handling of marked calls in one joint fixpoint. No new mechanism — one shared
fixpoint instead of two adjacent ones.

## 264. Wave 7 landed: step 46 + Task 7.2 steps 1–2 (2026-09-15)

Two slices in `4445956` (evidence in `done.md` → Phase 5 wave 7). Notes:

- **Phase 5's boundary-widening arc is closed** (steps 44–46): call, decl, assign, return, and
  combo edges all route dynamic values soundly. The remaining loud edges (method calls on marked
  class-typed results → `STA2006`, spread of marked calls → `STA1214`) are documented Phase-8
  dynamic-tier work, not silent gaps.
- **Task 7.2's header declares only what exists** — no `stator_init_<unit>` symbol that nothing
  defines yet. Steps 3–9 stay open in plan order.
- **Remaining Phase-5 surface:** opaque class uses, `extends NS.C` (namespace's own refusal),
  `instanceof` vs generic class (deliberate), integer-like computed class members, escape-position
  generics, custom-`toString` key coercion (Phase-8 ceiling), `c?.m` multi-class unions.

## 265. CI red-on-main triage: three fixes for the revert-bot gate (2026-09-15)

`main` was red since 2026-09-13 (every push auto-reverted): asan/linux `spawnSync ar ENOBUFS`,
six `extern_link` subset failures on Windows, and the test262 ratchet `passed 2372 → 2371`.
Evidence per fix (all three verified locally; CI is the cross-platform proof):

- **test262 `__proto__-duplicate.js` passed → skipped.** Step 26's 1117 carve-out (`49d8193`,
  "duplicate data keys are last-wins") is wrong for one shape: duplicate `__proto__` DATA
  properties are an early SyntaxError (spec B.3.1; Node: "Duplicate __proto__ fields are not
  allowed in object literals"). Suppression made the body checker-clean, so the gate ran and
  the assert.js prelude's own STA1214s (JSON/String globals, method calls) failed the build
  with nothing-but-STA12xx → skip instead of the negative-test pass. Fix: `program.ts`
  `isDuplicateProtoDataProperty` — a 1117 on a literal with ≥2 non-computed `PropertyAssignment`
  `__proto__` entries is never suppressed (STA0012, both modes effectively). Only that form
  counts: computed keys, shorthands, methods, spreads beside a data `__proto__` are legal
  last-wins (measured against the pinned Node) and stay dynamic. SUBSET.md step-26 row and
  two decision fixtures (`subset_object_literal_protodup_{js,ts}`) updated in the same change.
- **Windows `extern_link_*`: verdict static, want error (STA1119).** `parseLinkPragmas`
  (`extern.ts`) splits on `'\n'` and matches `/...(.*)$/` without the multiline flag — on a
  CRLF checkout (Windows default) `$` never matches before `\r`, so every pragma line is
  invisible and the file reads as pragma-free. Proven: old regex `false` on a `\r`-terminated
  line, `true` on LF. Fix strips one trailing `\r` per line (LF sources byte-identical);
  `@statorExtern` was never at risk (TS's own JSDoc parser). Reproduced the STA1119 verdicts
  locally with CRLF-converted helpers.
- **asan/linux ENOBUFS.** `readArchiveMember` (`asan-gate.ts`) uses `execFileSync` with the
  1 MiB default `maxBuffer`; the largest ASan member is already 0.6 MiB on macOS
  (`vendor_libregexp.o`) and Linux objects run larger, so `ar p` exceeds the buffer. Fix:
  explicit 64 MiB cap (the precedent the golden-asan spawn already uses); the gate holds all
  members in memory for the digest anyway.

## 266. Stale bundled linker vs newer Xcode SDK: Darwin link retry (2026-09-15)

This host upgraded to Xcode 26 (macOS 27.0 SDK) while the pinned conda clang 21.1.8 still
ships ld64-956.6, whose `.tbd` parser rejects the SDK's dotted arch variants
(`arm64e.x1-macos`): `malformed file ... unknown architecture`, system libs ignored,
`Undefined symbols ... ___assert_rtn ...` — every link fails, including a trivial
`int main`. Measured: `mise exec -- clang /tmp/tlink.c -o /tmp/tlink -lm` fails;
`SDKROOT=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX26.5.sdk` links;
`/usr/bin/clang` (Apple 21.0.0) links. Compiling is unaffected (only the link reads
`.tbd`); the ASan path is unaffected (already links via `/usr/bin/clang` on Darwin).
CI's macos-14/macos-15-intel images carry older SDKs, so this is host skew, not a
toolchain break — the fix is conditional and costs nothing on green hosts.

Fix (retry, not a switch): the first link runs exactly as before; only a failure carrying
the narrow signature (`.tbd` + `malformed file`/`unknown architecture`) retries once with
`-isysroot` at the newest CLT SDK whose `libSystem.tbd` has no dotted `arm64e` token
(plain `arm64e` parses fine and never disqualifies). Explicit `CC` is never second-guessed;
nothing is recorded in `link-flags.txt` (host state, like the ASan `CC` fallback).
`packages/compiler/src/support/toolchain.ts` owns the pure core (`isStaleLdSystemLibFailure`,
`pickFallbackSdk`, `staleLdRetryArgs` shared by the CLI link, the export-stubs consumer
link, and the FFI C-consumer link); `packages/compiler/src/cli/build.ts` link() captures
the link's stderr to classify it (replayed byte-identical on failure, so terminal output
is unchanged); the justfile's `_runtime-test` corpus link retries in bash the same way.
Pinned in `packages/tests/unit/toolchain-sdk.test.ts` (6 tests, no toolchain needed).

Evidence on this host: unit 540/540 (was 516 pass + 23 native-link failures + 1 consumer-link
failure), `test:ffi` 5/5 with 0 not-run (was 2 pass + 3 link-fail), the new
`packages/tests/ffi/example-c-consumer/c-consumer.ts` prints `ffi c-consumer: ok`,
`just runtime-test` matches Node. Full-golden proof cited separately when that run lands.

## 267. Wrong-code emission: ts-mode `with` reported STA1107 (2026-09-15)

Found by the diagnostics-allocator audit (report in-session, not yet a plan-notes entry of
its own): `gate.ts` emitted `STA1107` (prototype mutation) for a ts-mode `with` statement
and `notYet(..., 8)` for js-mode `with`, while `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md` allocates STA1109
(`both`/`never`) and `docs/SUBSET.md` + plan §1.2 (`with` is illegal in strict-mode ESM in
both modes) agree with the table, not the gate. Fix: both arms emit `never` STA1109.
The two `subset_with_statement_{ts,js}` fixtures (already `@code: STA1109`,
`@expected-fail`) flipped out of expected-fail in the same change: 2/2 pass.

## 268. Task 6.12 verification state (2026-09-15)

Verified in-session: `mise.toml` selects `node = "26.7.0"` exact, matching `.node-version`
(no re-baseline, pin never moved); `scripts/check-node.mjs` compares full versions and
refuses skew (pinned→match exit 0; bare v24.20.0, STATOR_NODE skew, unrunnable oracle, and
a scratch-copy `node = "26"` drift all refuse); engines stays a range floor by design.
The Check's `ci green` leg was blocked only by the entry-266 host link failure; with that
fixed the close-out (plan.md stub + done.md record) lands once the full-golden proof and
the in-flight test-runner work are integrated.

## 269. Differential js-5 transient + moon-parity disposition (2026-09-15)

**js-5 was a phantom, not a bug.** The new differential `--smoke` mode recorded a js-mode
divergence (`STA4072 ... reading 'darwin'` on the full source; stderr-format mismatch on
the minimized undeclared-variable program). Re-run on the settled tree
(`run.ts --seed=5 --count=1 --mode=js`) reports 0 divergences, and both sources build
clean in isolation. Cause: the smoke ran while `cli/build.ts` was mid-edit in the same
worktree — an in-process import of a half-written module, i.e. exactly the unreproducible
recording Task 6.10 exists to prevent. Stale `failures/js-5.*` removed (gitignored dir,
now empty). Rule restated for multi-agent work: re-run a divergence on a quiet tree
before triaging it, and never rebuild the archive mid-suite (entry 266).

**Moon parity audit: two real rows fixed, rest dispositioned.** `tests:coverage` gains the
missing `runtime:build` edge (same NATIVE_ONLY proofs as `unit`); `tests:subset` loses its
bogus one (in-process `explain` only — the edge purely serialized local iteration).
Naming drift (`test:runtime` vs `runtime-corpus`, …) is lookup friction, not a bug: left
as is. `ci.sh` staleness left as is — it is the pre-remote CI (`./ci.sh`, "until a remote
exists"), superseded by the workflow, not a gate anyone runs. Allocator audit rows #3–#5
(dead rows pending-by-design behind `@expected-fail` fixtures, STA1208's anti-reuse row,
one cosmetic phase-label skew) need no action; row #1/#2 (the `with`/STA1107 wrong code)
landed as entry 267.

## 270. Test-iteration sharding + generator follow-ups (2026-09-15)

**Sharding (local-iteration speed).** Task 6.6's in-process runners left subset/golden
single-threaded (golden: 113s wall at 119% CPU on 16 cores). `--shard=N/M` +
`--shards=N` fan-out (shared machinery in `tests/support/parallel.ts`, same
indexed-by-item ordering invariant as the pool) brings subset 663 fixtures 22s → 4.3s
and golden 386 fixtures 113s → 17s, both reports byte-identical serial-vs-sharded.
Default invocation is untouched. The same change's shared `tests/support/fixture-build.ts`
(`buildFixture`, `compileFixtureC`, `runNodeOracle` for golden + ffi) took `cpd` 1.0% →
0.9%, back under the gate with headroom.

**Generator wiring follow-up (Task 7.3 steps 6–7).** The generator refuses with
would-be gate codes today; macros/enums have no allocated code and `DIAGNOSTICS.md` was
deliberately untouched. Before generated bindings can build: (1) allocate a
generator-refusal STA family in `docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md` (sole allocator); (2) settle the
TS-name policy (mechanical camelCase `sqlite3Step` vs prefix-stripped `sqliteStep`) and
brand spelling (`Ptr_sqlite3_stmt` vs `SqliteStmt`); (3) emit `@statorLink`/`--link=`
provenance from the generator (NOTES.md gap); (4) regenerate SQLite and diff against the
manual oracle until the only deltas are policy choices from (2). The phase Check (plan
§10: SQLite queried from TS, callable from a C `main()`, in CI) waits on all four.

## 271. Task 7.3 lands: Out<T>, generator, SQLite Check (2026-09-15)

Nine background agents plus the main track closed the phase Check in one session. What
each owned: mini-header + generated binding, demo program + runner, C `main()` + CI
wiring, 12 decision fixtures, SUBSET.md rows, manual oracle update, node:sqlite oracle
shim, generator `--lib`/include/`Out` emission, STA1130 wiring + libm/stat examples.
File-partitioned, no commits from agents; integration, the `Out<T>` compiler core, and
every cross-track inconsistency resolved on the main track.

Load-bearing findings, each with its fix in-tree:

- `checker.getTypeArguments()` returns [] for alias instantiations — the args live in
  `type.aliasTypeArguments`. `outSlotInner` reads the alias field (unit-pinned).
- The monomorphization collector and the generic-alias-formation gate both claim the
  blessed call (`outSlot<Db>()` is generic in spelling only): the collector skips it
  (nothing to specialize — the ambient body does not exist), and aliasing the
  constructor as a value is STA1125 (it used to be a silent STA4021 through `f<Db>()`).
- Verdicts: every slot node reads `unknown`, so `out-new`/`out-get` cases must precede
  the type check (the `extern-call` precedent — below it they are dead code); `Out`
  declarations and `out-pointer` args are exempted via a recomputed name set
  (`collectOutSlots`, fixpoint for alias chains; aliases inside function bodies read
  dynamic, conservative).
- Copy semantics, documented in FFI.md §2: every binding owns its cell, so write and
  read through the same name. No addresses as values anywhere — nothing can dangle —
  which is also why user-function params/returns/throws/objects need no arms (sound
  bits; re-entry as `Out` is blocked by the type rules where it matters).
- Lexicographic SDK order lies (`MacOSX26.sdk` sorts after `MacOSX26.5.sdk`): version
  compare in the fallback picker, unit-pinned (a working fallback lost to a broken SDK).
- Two real C-level catches from the first linked demo: `(char**)` discards qualifiers
  against `const char**` (cast `(const char**)` under headers) and `char *` raw vs
  `const unsigned char*` returns trips `-Wpointer-sign` (explicit cast at copy-out).
- Demo form: `.d.ts` value-imports are STA0012 — bindings arrive via `/// <reference>`
  and bare calls (the golden pattern); the generator emits `./`-anchored includes so the
  prologue resolves binding-local headers against the declaring file.
- The `with`-shaped lesson, twice applied: generator refuses `const char**` tails until
  the `Out<CString>` mapping landed; the mini-header demo hand-checks every
  unconventioned return code (open/prepare/bind/finalize/close) so no nonzero return is
  silently discarded (FFI.md §4 absolute).

Responsibilities that stay open: the ambient `CString`/`Out` lib declarations (fixtures
declare locally until §7.3 owns the binding set — FFI.md §7.3), generator convention
transfer (manual rc checks until then), and the TS-name/brand alias policies
(mechanical, documented; human aliases live in manual bindings).

## 279. Inline generic arrows land: the 12(f) callback slice (2026-09-16)

**Plan:** §8 step 12(f). `plan.md` edited in this change (the (f) bullet records the landed
shape and the narrowed residue). Scope coordination: this is Agent 4's slice
(`agent/p5-generics`); 12(d)/12(e), 2488, and Phase 6/7/9/10 files untouched. Numbered past
the highest entry known (278 on `agent/p5-class-surface`); merge resolves any race. Step
12(c)'s spread residue and the (b) close-out belong to their owners' edits — this note
concurs on (b) by verification rather than re-editing it (notes 272, 277).

**What landed.** An inline generic arrow or function expression passed directly as a call
argument specializes at the parameter's function type: `[1].map(<T>(x: T): T => x)` and
`run(<T>(x: T): T => x, 5)` compile `static` and match Node byte-for-byte, in both modes.

- Frontend (`src/frontend/generics.ts`): `genericArgumentTuple` keeps the identifier path
  untouched and delegates every other argument to `inlineGenericTuple`, which unwraps
  parentheses, requires a direct non-spread argument position with a single parameter type,
  and shares the parameter lookup, unification, and `finishTuple` recovery through a common
  `instantiateAtParameter` — so the named and inline paths cannot disagree about what a
  parameter determines. The key is the position (`arrow@<file>#<offset>`), unspellable from
  source like every other specialization key, with the file base disambiguating the
  cross-file merge in `lowerProgram` (same-name dedupe is load-bearing there).
- Two refusals keep the gate/lowering contract (note 194's rule: a suppression that
  manufactures an `STA4xxx` is a bug report, not a landing). A body that reads an enclosing
  scope — an enclosing function's parameter or local, `this`, `super`, `new.target`, or a
  binding a block scopes away from the module top level — would resolve to no binding in a
  module-level specialization (`STA4035`), so the gate refuses it; the check is by symbol,
  so shadowing is safe, types erase (skipped whole), and member names are not reads (only
  the object side can be a capture). And a same-file `let`/`const`/`var` read is refused
  too: specialization bodies lower before their file's own statements, so only hoisted
  bindings are reachable in time — functions, classes, imports, and globals (all probed
  green). A `var` is the sharp case: its hoist feeds the lowering but not the verifier, so
  it fails as `STA4002` rather than `STA4035`.
- Lowering (`src/lower/index.ts`): no collection or use-site change — `requestArgument`
  and both argument-lowering paths already route through `genericArgumentTuple`. The one
  lowering edit is the display name: a homeless arrow keeps no name (Node prints anonymous
  for a callback-position arrow, as a non-generic inline arrow lowers today) while a named
  function expression keeps its own.
- Gate (`src/frontend/gate.ts`): `gateFunction` accepts exactly what the probe accepts
  (same function, both sides), and takes the checker as a parameter to do it. `let`-held,
  nested, branched, spread, and constructor-argument arrows stay `STA1214`, as do
  capturing and module-binding reads. Parenthesized arguments pair by the chain's top:
  the first cut paired by the bare arrow, found no parameter, and refused — caught by a
  probe (`run((<T>(x: T): T => x), 3)`), fixed, unit-pinned.

**Proof.** Unit: 12 new cases in `tests/unit/generics.test.ts` (tuple recovery with
computed position keys, separate specializations per literal, anonymous display, nested
compile, enclosing-tuple substitution, `STA4054`-clean, parenthesized pairing, three
refusal shapes) and the `anywhere-but-a-const` test narrowed to `let`/nesting. Decision: the
`subset_generic_arrow_bare_*` pair flips `not-yet` → `static`; four new pairs
(`inline_fnexpr`, `inline_nested` static; `inline_capture`, `inline_module_binding`
`not-yet` `STA1214`). Golden: `tests/golden/ts/generic_inline.ts` +
`tests/golden/js/generic_inline/main.ts` match the pinned Node 26.7.0 byte-for-byte.
Suites on this branch: unit 575/575, subset 683 (645 passed, 38 expected-fail, 0 failed),
golden 388/388 (and the same 388 under ASan/UBSan), `tsc` both projects, oxlint/oxfmt
clean, `cpd` 0.9%, builtins 223/238 (standing residue), leak plateau, runtime corpus match,
differential 24 cases with 0 divergences. Test262 `arrow-function` slice before/after
(pristine worktree at the base commit vs this branch): 75 passed / 466 skipped / 25 failed
of 566 on both — zero movement, as the mechanism predicts (a `.js` parse cannot produce
syntactic type parameters, so the inline path is unreachable there; the identifier path is
the same body). `ratchet.json` untouched.

**Drift reconciled in this change.** The `TypeParameter` gate comment still said a
constraint or default "is refused" — true of no code in the tree (`gateTypeParameter`
accepts both; the constraint is the checker's, the default fills the tuple in
`finishTuple`) — reworded to the landed semantics. `docs/SUBSET.md`'s generics row now
names the inline shape and the narrowed residue. The 12(f) plan bullet, which listed all
six constructs as open with no mention of waves 4–5, now records the landed shapes with
their evidence and the residue above.

**Verified, not built (the prove half).** 2454 (suppression + widening), 2683 (option),
2769 (overload fallback), 2464 (js suppression + `ToPropertyKey` coercion), and every
landed 12(f) shape (constrained/defaulted/explicit/undetermined/classes/value) are green
in this branch's subset + golden runs — concurring with notes 272 and 277, whose edits
carry the (b) close-out and the 12(e) narrowing respectively.

**Pre-existing gap found, not widened.** A NAMED generic whose body reads a same-file
`let`/`const`/`var` is accepted by the gate and fails downstream: `const base = 100` with a
generic body reading `base` fails as `STA4035` (a `var` in js mode as `STA4002`, whose hoist
feeds the lowering but not the verifier). The inline path refuses those reads; the named
path predates the rule. Follow-up (not this slice): refuse module-order-blind reads for
named generics at the gate, or lower specialization bodies after their file's statements.
