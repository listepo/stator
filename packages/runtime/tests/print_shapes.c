/* print_shapes.c — dynamic objects (shape table + inline caches) through jsrt_print.
 *
 * Ground truth is Node: print_shapes.mjs builds the SAME objects with plain object literals and
 * property assignment, in the same order; `just runtime-test` diffs the two byte-for-byte.
 *
 * Beyond "properties print in insertion order", this pins: a dynamic object prints exactly like
 * an object literal (no constructor name — Node cannot tell them apart); a missing property reads
 * `undefined`; an overwrite changes the value without changing the order; a non-identifier key
 * prints quoted; and reads through one shared inline cache stay correct across a shape-sharing
 * hit, a transition (the cached shape goes stale), and an unrelated shape.
