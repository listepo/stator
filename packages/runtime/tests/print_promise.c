/* print_promise.c — the promise corpus: print forms, reaction ordering, and Promise.all.
 *
 * Ground truth is Node (runtime/tests/print_promise.mjs), which is the only reason this file can
 * assert anything about ORDER. Reaction ordering is the part of a promise implementation that is
 * easy to get subtly wrong -- one tick early or late -- and impossible to check against yourself.
 *
 * The two sides express "subscribe a reaction" differently on purpose: here it is a native
 * continuation, there it is `.then`. That is the same mechanism at both ends of Task 4.6's design
 * (a reaction is a C function plus state, and `.then` will become a client of it), and the whole
 * question this corpus asks is whether it ticks like the spec's.
 *
 * Everything is registered synchronously and the queue is drained ONCE at the end, which is what a
 * Node script does with its own microtask queue -- so the two programs have the same shape and the
 * diff is about ordering rather than about where each side chose to drain.
