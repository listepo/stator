/* jsrt_error.c — the standard Error objects (plan.md §8 step 2a(c)).
 *
 * An Error needs no representation of its own. It is an OBJECT with a class descriptor, exactly as
 * a Map is: `cls` first, one descriptor per class in the whole program, and `parent` linking a
 * subclass to `Error`. That single link is what makes `e instanceof TypeError` and
 * `e instanceof Error` both true through the same pointer walk `jsrt_instanceof` already does for
 * user classes — there is no second mechanism here, only a descriptor chain the runtime owns
 * instead of the emitter.
 *
 * `name` and `message` are SLOTS rather than anything cleverer. That makes `e.name` and `e.message`
 * ordinary fixed-shape reads, resolved by the same `fixed_get` every other object uses, with no
 * special case anywhere in jsrt_shape.c. The cost is one honest divergence, recorded rather than
 * hidden: in Node both properties are non-enumerable, so `Object.keys(e)` is `[]` and here it is
 * `['name', 'message']`. Non-enumerability is a property-descriptor feature the subset does not
 * have at all (Object.defineProperty is a Phase 8 not-yet), so this is the same gap showing through
 * a new hole, not a new one. Printing an error is the other divergence and it is inherent: Node's
 * `console.log(err)` writes a stack trace, which this runtime does not have (see jsrt_uncaught).
