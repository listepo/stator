//! The shape table: hidden classes for dynamic objects (docs/VALUE.md §4.10; the layout and its
//! invariants are the header block over JSRTShape in jsrt_value.h). jsrt_shape.c keeps the property
//! semantics built on it -- inline caches, accessors, the TypeErrors -- and reaches the table only
//! through the functions below (src/jsrt_mem.h).
//!
//! A transition reuses an existing child before allocating, because shape sharing is the entire
//! point: two objects that gained the same keys in the same order must land on the same shape, or
//! every inline cache downstream of them degrades to the slow path. Shapes hold no values and are
//! immortal metadata (the table only grows, by design), so they are plain malloc; slot storage holds
//! jsrt_values, so it is a COLLECTED allocation the collector scans.
