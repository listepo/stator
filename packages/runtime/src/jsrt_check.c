/* jsrt_check.c — `typeof`, and the boundary checks that make a type annotation true.
 *
 * These two live together because they are the same question asked for two purposes. `typeof` asks
 * a value what it is and hands the answer to the program; a boundary check asks the same question
 * and compares the answer to what the program already claimed, refusing to continue if the claim
 * was a lie. The second is why golden rule 4 is enforceable: TypeScript's types are unsound, so an
 * `unknown` that narrows to `string` has been ASSERTED to be a string, not proven to be one, and
 * the check is where the assertion is settled (plan.md §0.2, docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md STA2001).
