/* The GC hygiene test (plan.md §7 Task 4.5): compile a loop that allocates ten million objects and
 * watch the process's RSS while it runs, then do the same for the FFI string-conversion loop
 * (strings.ts) — one watcher, one cap, one plateau rule, a row per loop in FIXTURES below.
 *
 * This is the one test that can tell whether the rooting discipline is doing its job END TO END.
 * The frame audit (tests/unit/frames.test.ts) proves the emitted C declares the slots it writes;
 * the golden tests prove the answers are right. Neither would notice a runtime that simply never
 * frees — a program that allocates 10M objects and keeps every one of them prints exactly the same
 * number as one that collects. Only the memory says which happened.
 *
 * The measurement is RSS sampled from `ps`, not a counter the runtime keeps, because a counter
 * would be the runtime grading its own homework. What is asserted is a PLATEAU, never a specific
 * figure: the peak stays inside a bound no non-collecting run could meet, and the tail does not
 * keep climbing. Ten million two-field objects are ~320 MB if nothing is ever freed, so a cap of
 * 64 MB separates the two outcomes by a factor of five — wide enough that allocator bookkeeping,
 * a different page size, or a differently tuned collector cannot move a passing run across it.
 *
 * Boehm is optional (`pkg-config bdw-gc`), and without it the runtime is plain malloc with no
 * collection — by design, and documented as such. There is no plateau to find in that build, so
 * this test REPORTS that it did not run rather than failing, and rather than passing quietly.
