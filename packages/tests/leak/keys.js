// Computed-key reads of keys the receiver never stores (plan T16).

// Each miss used to intern a UTF-8 key for the life of the process: malloc(3*len+1)
// plus a 24-byte intern node, neither of which Boehm can collect. Across 2_000_000
// distinct decimal keys the retained floor is about 80 MB (the 1_000_000 seven-digit
// keys alone are 46 bytes each), above the shared 64 MB cap. A run that frees the
// conversion retains only the empty object, so RSS plateaus in the same few MB as
// objects.ts. The checksum is the miss count: a runtime that skipped the reads
// could not print it.
