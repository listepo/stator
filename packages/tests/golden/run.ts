/* Golden-test runner (plan.md §5 Task 2.6).
 *
 * Usage: node packages/tests/golden/run.ts [--filter <substring> | --filter=<substring>]
 *          [--shard=N/M] [--shards=N]
 *
 * `--shard=N/M` runs one round-robin slice of the (filtered) fixtures; `--shards=N` fans out to
 * N worker processes of this same runner and merges their per-item records back by index, so the
 * merged report is byte-identical to the serial one. Both compose with `--filter`, which applies
 * first. In-process `build()` still shells clang out per fixture, but the TypeScript-host half of
 * the work is single-threaded CPU, so `--shards` is what scales a local iteration with cores;
 * the default stays single-process.
 *
 * Ground truth is the pinned Node in .node-version — that Node and only that Node.
 * Each fixture under tests/golden/ts|js is (a) compiled by stator and executed, and
 * (b) executed directly by Node. stdout must match BYTE-FOR-BYTE, number formatting
 * included (Ryu shortest-round-trip). A mismatch is a semantics bug: never loosen the
 * comparison to make it pass.
