 * Which refusals stay fatal in js mode (plan-notes 297): every syntactic diagnostic and every

 * silent miscompile at worst (`const c = 1; c = 2` printed 2 where Node throws a TypeError). */

 * TS2307 ("cannot find module") on a `std/…` specifier is the std edge's refusal, not a checker
 * error: `std/foo` resolves to no file because no such module exists (STA3002), or because it is
 * a threads module that has not landed (STA1214, Phase 10) — the same answer the gate gives a
 * specifier that did resolve (gate.ts `gateImport`), so the code never depends on whether a
 * stray file happens to sit where the mapping looked. TS2305/TS2724/TS2614 ("has no exported
 * member") on a std module's Promise twin (`readTextAsync` from `std/fs`) is the same kind of refusal:
 * the member waits for T10.2 (T10.1 step 5). A Node built-in is the platform edge's (`./node.ts`):
 * without `--node` it names the flag, and under it an unlanded module or member names T11.6.
 *
 * An unresolved `require` is the gate's: it rules on `require` in every file, including the `.js`
 * ones where the checker binds the name itself and reports nothing. */
