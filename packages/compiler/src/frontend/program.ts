/* The checker refusals js mode drops, because each one refuses an operation the DYNAMIC RUNTIME

 * JavaScript whose answer is a value rather than a type (plan.md §8 steps 2, 2a).
 *
 * Suppressing the CODE and not the OPTION is the whole design. `strictNullChecks: false` (or
 * `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: false`) is program-wide, so in a mixed graph it would strip null
 * safety from the `.ts` half and delete the boundary checks §0.4 requires. Leaving `T | undefined`
 * in the type is the point: the union lowers to the dynamic path and the check still happens, at
 * run time, which is where a dynamic value's check belongs.
 *
 * Nothing in here is a free pass for a REAL refusal — an operation no runtime could settle stays a
 * hard error in both modes, and that is why the list is enumerated rather than ranged. */

  2551, // Property 'x' does not exist on type 'T'. Did you mean 'y'?
  2353, // Object literal may only specify known properties.
  2349, // This expression is not callable.
  // `"" == 0` is not a mistake in JavaScript, it is the coercion table, and running that table is
  // most of what js mode is for. ts mode keeps it: there both operand types are known and disjoint
  // (plan-notes 177).
  2367, // This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types have no overlap.
  2362, // Left-hand side of arithmetic operation must be numeric.
  2363, // Right-hand side of arithmetic operation must be numeric.
  // Same table, spelled for one operand: `1 + undefined` is NaN, not a mistake. Test262 asserts
  // exactly that in `language/expressions/addition/S11.6.1_A3.1_*` (plan-notes 194).
  18050, // The value 'undefined' cannot be used here.
  // `var x = 1; var x = 'a'` is one binding assigned twice -- legal JavaScript, and a redeclaration
  // TypeScript refuses only because it wants one type per name.
  2403, // Subsequent variable declarations must have the same type.
  // A style lint, not a refusal: the comma operator's answer is its right operand either way.
  2695, // Left side of comma operator is unused and has no side effects.
  // A COMMENT cannot refuse a program. JSDoc is checker metadata; the parameter list is the code.
  8024, // JSDoc '@param' tag has name 'X', but there is no parameter with that name.
  8029, // JSDoc '@param' tag has name 'X', ... It would match 'arguments' if it had an array type.
  // Writing through a read-only reference IS the operation `Object.freeze` exists to define, and
  // its answer is a TypeError the runtime now raises as a real Error object -- catchable, with
  // Node's wording and a working `instanceof` (plan.md §8 step 2a(c), plan-notes 195). Before that
  // model existed these two had to stay: a refusal whose runtime answer the runtime could not build
  // is not a refusal js mode may drop.
  // A name nothing declares is not a type error, it is a RUNTIME question, and now that the Error
  // model exists the runtime can answer it: `ReferenceError: x is not defined`, catchable, with
  // Node's wording (plan.md §8 step 2a(c)). This is the largest bucket the sweep left, and it is
  // the one that needed no runtime it did not have -- only somewhere for the answer to come from.
  // 2552 is the same refusal with a spelling suggestion attached.
  2304, // Cannot find name 'X'.
  2552, // Cannot find name 'X'. Did you mean 'Y'?
  2540, // Cannot assign to 'X' because it is a read-only property.
  2704, // The operand of a 'delete' operator cannot be a read-only property.
  // TypeScript refuses `delete` on a REQUIRED property because deleting one would falsify the
  // type; JavaScript's answer is a boolean and a key that is gone. Both codes could only be
  // dropped once the operator existed to answer them (plan.md §8 step 2a(c)): 2704's answer is the
  // frozen-object TypeError `jsrt_delete` raises with Node's wording, and 2790's is the ordinary
  // removal. In `ts` mode 2790 stays a refusal, and that is not an inconsistency -- it is the
  // rule that keeps a fixed shape from being asked to lose a slot it has no encoding for.
  2790, // The operand of a 'delete' operator must be optional.
  // The exactOptionalPropertyTypes family. The option stays ON in both modes -- turning it off is
  // program-wide and would strip the .ts half of a mixed graph of the same guarantee -- but in js
  // mode these three codes refuse ordinary JavaScript: `{ value: undefined }` for a `value?: string`
  // parameter is how Test262's own propertyHelper writes a descriptor, and 2340 of the 7276
  // remaining Test262 failures say it. Unlike 2322/2345 this needs no widening and no coercion,
  // because the disagreement is only over whether `undefined` is a permitted VALUE for an optional
  // property, and `undefined` is a value the runtime already represents in the slot. The absent /
  // present-as-undefined distinction EOPT exists to police survives: the shape model tracks presence,
  // so `{}` and `{ value: undefined }` still differ in `Object.keys` and in `console.log`
  // (tests/golden/js/optional_undefined.js pins exactly that, not just the reads).
  2375, // Type 'X' is not assignable to type 'Y' with 'exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true' (target's properties).
  2379, // Argument of type 'X' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Y' with 'exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true'.
  2412, // Type 'X' is not assignable to type 'Y' with 'exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true' (the target).
  // Duplicate data-property keys in an object literal are legal JavaScript — last wins — and
  // §1.2 says js mode never rejects untyped code; the diagnostic is tsc's grammar check, not a
  // type error (plan.md §8 step 26). The lowering pushes one entry per written property and the
  // emitter stores in source order into one slot, so the last write wins on its own; the verifier
  // covers the shape by name, not by position. ts mode keeps the refusal (STA0012). Duplicate
  // METHODS, duplicate accessors, and mixed property/accessor duplicates are different checker
  // codes (2300, 1118, 1119) and stay refused in both modes.
  1117, // An object literal cannot have multiple properties with the same name.
  // The possibly-null family: 3855 of Task 6.1's 10,513 Test262 failures, the largest bucket by a
  // factor of three, and every one of them ordinary JavaScript that runs (plan-notes 176, 180).
  // `xs[i].toFixed(2)` is how JavaScript indexes an array; the spec's answer for the miss is a
  // TypeError at run time, which is a fact about the value and not a reason to refuse the program.
  2531, // Object is possibly 'null'.
  2532, // Object is possibly 'undefined'.
