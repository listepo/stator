/* The lowering's lexical scope (plan.md §8 step 14, plan-notes 215).
 *
 * HIR names are SOURCE names, and that is not a shorthand -- it is the contract every consumer
 * downstream relies on: the verifier's binding map, the emitter's slot table, the capture analysis
 * and the passes all key bindings by the name written in the program. The one place it breaks is
 * SHADOWING. `const x = 1; { const x = 2; }` is two bindings and one name, so all of those
 * consumers give the two one home: the block's write lands in the outer slot and the outer `x`
 * reads back 2, where the pinned Node says 1 (plan-notes 209).
 *
 * The fix is alpha-renaming at the lowering: a declaration that would SHADOW a visible binding is
 * emitted under a fresh name no source can spell, and every reference inside that scope resolves
 * to the fresh name. Nothing downstream learns about scopes -- it only ever sees names that are
 * already distinct, which is what makes this correct by construction for all of them at once.
 *
 * Two facts are kept apart on purpose. `ownTypes` is what a name means; `ownHirNames` is what
 * it is CALLED in the HIR. They differ only for a renamed binding, and every declaration records
 * both, so a reference can ask for the spelling without knowing whether a rename happened. */
