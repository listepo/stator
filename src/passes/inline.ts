/* Inlining (plan.md §5 Tasks 3.8–3.9) — replace a call to a small, non-recursive function with the
 * expression it returns.
 *
 * The HIR has no block-expression, so a general inliner would have to restructure statements:
 * temporaries for the arguments, a result binding, and every `return` in the body rewritten to an
 * assignment plus a jump. That machinery is worth building against a measurement, and there is none
 * yet (§13). What is built here is the case that needs none of it — a body that is exactly one
 * `return <expr>`, which substitutes into the call's own position.
 *
 * Four conditions, each closing one way substitution can change meaning:
 *
 *  1. **The body is a single `return <expr>`.** No statements to place, and no assignment to a
 *     parameter, so substituting an argument for a parameter name cannot be observed as aliasing.
 *  2. **The body names nothing but its own parameters.** This is the condition that does the most
 *     work. It makes recursion impossible by construction — a recursive body must name itself —
 *     and it closes the capture hazard that has nothing to do with closures: a body reading a
 *     module-level `g` moved into a caller that has its OWN `g` would silently start reading the
 *     caller's. There is no scope information in the HIR to rule that out, so the pass declines to
 *     move any free name at all.
 *  3. **Every argument is a literal or an identifier.** A parameter used twice duplicates its
 *     argument, and one used zero times drops it — both fine for a value that cannot have a side
 *     effect, both wrong for a call. This also makes evaluation ORDER a non-question, which
 *     matters because substitution reorders arguments relative to the body's own operations.
 *  4. **Types agree exactly** — argument to parameter, and the returned expression to the call.
 *     `Unknown` preservation is this condition: a `js`-mode call whose argument is a `number` but
 *     whose parameter is `Unknown` does NOT inline, because splicing the argument in would quietly
 *     replace an unknown-typed subtree with a typed one and cancel the boundary check that
 *     unknown-ness exists to require.
 *
 * Arity must match too. JavaScript pads missing arguments with `undefined` and drops extra ones,
 * and while the `ts`-mode checker has already rejected a mismatch, `js` mode reaches this pass as
 * well — so the agreement is checked rather than assumed.
